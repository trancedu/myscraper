2021-09-29T21:35:47,Why Anett Rolikova of Ethereum Magicians Doesn't Like EIP-1559,https://wp.decrypt.co/82234/why-anett-rolikova-ethereum-magicians-doesnt-like-eip-1559/,"EIP-1559, the August  protocol change to ""burn"" transaction fees and thereby goose ETH's value, feels like ancient history by now. But one of the top voices in Ethereum makes the case that it should be revisited. Anett Rolikova is part of the three-person leadership team of the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians, which coordinates discussion around changes to the blockchain's code and technical fixes. She told Decrypt at last week's Messari Mainnet conference that EIP-1559 has been a disappointment.""It's very controversial even for me, kind of an Ethereum core member,"" she said, adding later that because of the change ""Ethereum became so unusable. I mean it's usable for people who can afford such high gas fees.""EIP-1559 was an Ethereum Improvement Proposal to add deflationary pressure to the Ethereum network. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a cap of 21 million coins, Ethereum until recently had no way of curbing endless inflation. EIP-1559 solved that by charging users a flat fee for most transactions (except in cases of high network congestion). That meant no more guessing how much to give the miners who validate transactions. And no more paying fees directly to miners. Instead, that ETH would be destroyed. Now, with each new block that's created, miners receive a couple of ETH as a reward but a little bit of the currency supply disappears forever.Toward the beginning of September, EIP-1559 appeared to be a clear success. The price of ETH was up around 50% since the code change went into effect, brushing up against $4,000 for the first time since May. Miners' revenue was also trending upward—in both ETH and dollar terms—despite their concerns that 1559 would take money out of their pockets.But with the price of ETH slouching back toward pre-1559 levels, things look less rosy for users, who must still time their transactions to avoid periods of high congestion. (Though it's impossible to know what would have happened without the change.)And Rolikova is right about the fees going up. Those behind EIP-1559 said beforehand the reduction of fees would be modest, but fees have instead risen. Although they haven't hit some of the levels seen during late 2020 and early 2021 when DeFi and then NFT mania hit Ethereum, August and September saw sharp increases. According to data from Glassnode, in June and July, the average ETH transaction fee was 0.002 ETH ($4.64 at the time) and 0.0025 ($5.32), respectively. In August, it more than doubled to nearly 0.006 ($18.14) as the price of ETH also ballooned.Rolikova said the shift was hard to forecast, even after deploying economic models. Who could tell, for instance, that the market for Ethereum-based NFT collectibles would show staying power? But, she said, it's not too late: ""I have a very dumb idea which people will not agree with, which is fork Ethereum back to pre-EIP-1559 and just leave it like that.""The Ethereum Magician is only half-joking, and she knows it won't really happen. However, it's the type of conversation she moderates on the Fellowship's forum—and indicative of the discourse among core devs, who don't always agree on the path forward.Mostly, people have moved on. ""There are many other EIPs that are trying to get onto the chain"" in advance of the next network upgrade in a few months, she said.Not everyone will agree on which ones are deserving."

2021-09-29T19:36:02,"PayPal, Google Execs to Help Bank of England 'Understand' Digital Currency",https://wp.decrypt.co/82223/bank-england-cbdc-digital-currency-paypal-spotify-google/,"The Bank of England today announced members of two forums that will explore a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the UK. The forum members include PayPal and Google bigwigs among representatives from many Silicon Valley giants.CBDCs are digital versions of a fiat currency—like pound sterling, the euro or dollar—backed by a central bank. Countries around the world are currently researching the benefits of developing them. Some countries—such as China and the Bahamas—have already rolled out or are in the testing stages of a CBDC project.The UK has so far been comparatively slow, and has only announced research into such an asset. But today’s announcement shows that the Bank of England is at least consulting with top experts in the tech and finance space. The forum will research and provide feedback to the Bank on how a CBDC could—or couldn't—work in the UK.""The Forum will help the Bank to understand the technological challenges of designing, implementing and operating a CBDC,"" the announcement read. The members of the CBDC Engagement Forum and CBDC Technology Forum include Edwin Aoki, who serves as CTO, blockchain, cryptocurrency and digital currencies at PayPal, Matthieu Saint Olive, the CBDC and payments manager at ConsenSys, and Ashley Lannquist, project lead, blockchain and digital currency at the World Economic Forum. (Disclosure: ConsenSys Mesh funds an editorially independent Decrypt.)Other members include Mark Shaw, director of global payments strategy for music streaming provider Spotify, Charlotte Hogg, the CEO of Visa Europe, and Diana Layfield, the president of EMEA partnerships at Google. The two forums merged in April to explore whether a CBDC will work in the UK. The idea with a CBDC, in the UK at least, is that it would work to compliment cash but would be a fast and secure way of sending money and making payments.  Bank of England boss Andrew Bailey has repeatedly said that he doesn’t consider decentralized digital assets, like , to be money. But he has said —assets pegged to fiat currencies though different to CBDCs—could become an important part of the future financial landscape. "
2021-09-29T18:28:59,Twitter Shares Sneak Peek of Its Ethereum NFT Verification,https://wp.decrypt.co/82216/twitter-shares-sneak-peek-ethereum-nft-verification/,"The Crypto Twitter elite either covet or deride the blue-check mark atop their profile, which both verifies the authenticity of the account and separates them from the hoi polloi.But like it or not, Twitter verification is coming for , the digital tokens that represent ownership in a real or virtual asset. A developer with the company today shared early, experimental glimpses of the feature.Twitter Spaces software engineer Mada Aflak showed a quick demo in which a person would click on their avatar and select an NFT from their crypto wallet. After downloading their NFTs from OpenSea, a popular marketplace for the digital collectibles, they can put the NFT in their avatar—complete with the customary blue checkmark to show that they're the true owner of the image. Aflak stressed that this is just an experiment with a mockup—nothing is final—and she solicited questions and suggestions from users. But it's an exciting step forward for the feature.NFTs have become akin to social currency of late as devotees of  and other  blockchains have recently begun posting their digital possessions as profile photos. But the nature of NFTs, many of which are JPEGs, means that anyone can copy and paste someone else's NFT into their own profile image. Just as there are multiple fake Vitalik Buterin accounts, now there could be multiple accounts with the same Bored Ape.Twitter's NFT feature should solve for that, but not everyone thinks it will. Bitcoin maximalist grublés (no blue check mark) of blockchain tech firm Blockstream wrote: ""Twitter's NFT authentication looks incredibly easy to defeat, and will just devolve into a pile of disputes which will ultimately be resolved by a Twitter person in a cubicle somewhere, proving the 'centralization, but with more steps' meme we've come to know and love about ETH.""While it's hard to reach that conclusion from a mere mockup video, it's still unclear how committed the Jack Dorsey-led tech firm is to creating tools for users of Ethereum, where the bulk of NFTs originated. Dorsey, a Bitcoin proponent, is famously averse to Ethereum, saying in June he wouldn't invest in it. In a press conference last week announcing the feature (along with Bitcoin tipping), executive Esther Crawford went out of her way to avoid using the E-word. ""By allowing people to connect their Bitcoin wallets, they can track and showcase their NFT ownership on Twitter,"" Crawford said. Nonetheless, Aflak's online demo showed a glimpse of prominent Ethereum wallet MetaMask."
2021-09-29T17:27:41,El Salvador Takes ‘First Steps’ to Mining Bitcoin With Volcanoes,https://wp.decrypt.co/82201/el-salvador-volcano-bitcoin-mining-first-steps/,"El Salvador’s president has said via a Twitter video that the country started its project to use geothermal energy—from volcanoes—to mine Bitcoin. President Nayib Bukele, an avid Twitter user, posted the video yesterday with the caption, “First steps,” accompanied by a volcano emoji. The short clip, which already has 1.8 million views, showed a data center in a forest. It then zoomed in on a worker inside the center hooking up a wire to a Bitcoin mining machine. Bitcoin mining is the energy-intensive process of using powerful computers to verify transactions on the blockchain. Bitcoin mining has come under scrutiny lately because of the sheer amount of energy it uses. More and more mining companies are now looking for clean energy to produce the asset. Bukele said in June that El Salvador’s state-owned electricity company LaGeo would use ""very cheap, 100% clean, 100% renewable, 0 emissions energy from our volcanos"" to mine Bitcoin. El Salvador controversially made Bitcoin legal tender in the country on September 7. It is the first country in the world to do so. The idea is the brainchild of the country’s millennial president, who came to power in 2019. Despite Bukele being popular in the country (recent polls put his approval rating above 80%), the president’s Bitcoin Law has been criticized by the likes of the World Bank—and some Salvadorans.Citizens slammed the idea earlier this month when thousands took to the streets to protest against the president—which were the biggest protests since Bukele took power, according to local media. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law says that businesses have to accept payment in Bitcoin if they have the technology. Citizens don’t have to use it but are encouraged to do so by the government: there is a state wallet, called Chivo, and those who download it to their smartphone are rewarded $30 in Bitcoin. Salvadorans have shared images on Twitter of their cryptocurrency gifts since using the wallet. The wallet had technical issues at first but Bukele now claims more citizens are using the wallet than any bank in the country. "
2021-09-29T15:01:03,San Jose to Fund Low-Income Internet Access With Helium Crypto Mining,https://wp.decrypt.co/82148/san-jose-low-income-internet-access-crypto-mining-helium/," is a  startup with an inventive approach to wireless connectivity: rather than rely on major wireless carriers, it uses a network of user-operated nodes distributed around the world to power Internet of Things (IoT) devices. That kind of out-of-the-box thinking is now being used to fund a public-benefit project as well.Today,  and the City of San Jose, California, announced a public-private partnership to help fund internet access for low-income households within the city. More than 1,300 households will receive a $120 payment on a gift card to help pay for home broadband service, and the pilot program is funded by the cryptocurrency mined by Helium nodes.To be clear, it’s not Helium’s actual network that these households will tap into for internet access. Helium’s low-energy LongFi network is designed strictly for devices like sensors and trackers, and it isn’t built to handle connections from laptops and smartphones.Instead, San Jose has deployed 20 Helium nodes—paid for by the California Emerging Technology Fund (CETF)—around the city, and they’re being operated by volunteers and small businesses. By sharing wireless connectivity with nearby devices, each node “mines” or earns Helium’s HNT reward tokens, which can be swapped for other cryptocurrencies at an exchange. Those funds will fuel the payments made to eligible low-income households.San Jose is the 10th most populous city in the United States, with more than one million residents. Jordan Sun, chief innovation officer for the city’s Mayor's Office, told Decrypt that more than 50% of residents cite cost as the top limiting factor when it comes to broadband internet access at home—even at a discounted rate of $10 per month.“The San Jose Mayor’s Office Of Technology and Innovation (MOTI) began seeking more creative pathways to reduce the economic barriers to broadband for low-income families without relying on tax hikes, raising philanthropic dollars, or undertaking multi-year infrastructure projects to solve for the digital divide,” said Sun.MOTI began conversations with Helium after looking into how blockchain-based solutions could potentially self-fund such initiatives. “This pilot will demonstrate how cities can leverage emerging technologies and creative business models to generate revenues that directly address a pain point facing residents,” Sun added.Helium’s LongFi network has scaled rapidly of late, with more than 200,000 hotspot nodes now deployed around the world. That’s nearly double the amount (112,000) from August 10, when the project announced a $111 million funding round led by VC firm Andreessen Horowitz.Every additional node that is deployed only helps strengthen the distributed blanket of coverage. Funding internet access for San Jose residents is an added bonus, then.“I don't think there's any other crypto-based project that's been able to achieve something that's connecting people that are usually disconnected—both economically as well as physically connected to the internet,” Helium Chief Operating Officer Frank Mong told Decrypt. “We're incredibly humbled that we can participate and be a part of that process to really bring folks from all socioeconomic backgrounds into the mix.”Separate from its LongFi network, Helium is also building a 5G network for smartphones and other devices in partnership with FreedomFi. The Helium 5G network will take a similar approach with user-run nodes that reward operators with cryptocurrency tokens, supplemented by connectivity provided by major wireless carriers.Mong told Decrypt that Helium’s growing 5G wireless network could also provide a more direct way to provide internet access to low-income households and underserved communities. Whether it’s an approach like that or a larger-scale initiative in the same vein as San Jose’s, Helium hopes to pursue additional projects to benefit the public good.“I would love it if we could help other cities around the country and around the world,” Mong said, particularly given the increased need for internet access for remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. “We definitely hope that we can do this elsewhere.”"

The firm expects an even larger turnout for October’s FanDome 2021—and will use  to help draw in viewers and spread the word about the stream.Today, the WarnerMedia-owned DC announced a partnership with Palm NFT Studio to create a new line of NFTs tied into the upcoming streaming event. DC will offer up digital collectibles based on popular comic book covers, with the line featuring characters such as Batman, Wonder Woman, Superman, Harley Quinn, and Green Lantern.And they’re all free. Starting October 5, DC will offer a free NFT to anyone who registers to attend the DC FanDome 2021 streaming event on October 16. Users can unlock a second free NFT by also sharing word about the event via social media.Given the size of the viewer base for last year’s streaming event, DC suggests that this will be “very likely one of the largest NFT drops ever,” per an announcement. Palm could deliver potentially millions of free NFTs with this DC launch, a representative confirmed, depending on demand.An NFT is like a receipt for a rare digital item, as verified by a . NFTs can take all sorts of forms, including still or animated images, video clips, functional video game items, and more. In this case, DC plans to give away digital recreations of both classic and modern comic book covers.DC Publisher and Chief Creative Officer Jim Lee “hand-selected” the artwork used for each collectible, according to an announcement, and each comic cover will be available in three rarity levels.A representative for Palm tells Decrypt that this is the first step in an ongoing partnership with DC, and that they may release premium collectibles in the future. Palm uses a layer-2 scaling solution on top of  to minimize fees, congestion, and energy consumption for minting NFTs.Although DC’s press release suggests that this is the firm’s “first collection of NFTs,” DC has previously released NFT collectibles through the VeVe platform. VeVe also works with rival comic book maker Marvel, releasing 3D “digital statues” that can be viewed in augmented reality, as well as rare comic book covers.Earlier this year, amidst the NFT market’s first big boom—with $2.5 billion in total trading volume in the first half of the year—DC Comics reportedly told its freelance artists not to sell independent NFTs featuring DC’s characters.The reported memo came soon after longtime comic book artist José Delbo generated some $1.85 million worth of Ethereum from selling Wonder Woman-themed NFTs on the MakersPlace marketplace in March. DC claimed in the memo that it was exploring its own NFT initiatives, potentially foreshadowing this newly-announced alliance with Palm for FanDome 2021.Launched in March, Palm NFT Studio is a joint venture between Ethereum studio/incubator ConsenSys, film studio Heyday Films, and art services company HENI. ConsenSys also funds an editorially independent Decrypt."
2021-09-29T13:40:23,European Institutional Investors Are Embracing Ethereum DeFi: Chainalysis,https://wp.decrypt.co/82182/european-institutional-investors-are-embracing-ethereum-defi-chainalysis/,"The region of Central, Northern, and Western Europe (CNWE) has become the world’s largest cryptocurrency economy thanks to the proliferation of decentralized finance (), according to the latest report by crypto analytics firm Chainalysis.Per the report, CNWE has received more than $1 trillion worth of crypto in the past 12 months which amounts to 25% of the corresponding global activity in total.“Having ranked second last year, CNWE’s new position in the top spot is the result of tremendous growth starting in July 2020, combined with a relative decline in activity in Eastern Asia,” the researchers said.DeFi is a blanket term for a network of decentralized, non-custodial financial protocols focused on lending, yield farming, crypto derivatives, and other products. DeFi allows regular users to participate in a sprawling financial system without the need for any third-party intermediaries such as banks and other financial institutions.Larger traditional institutional players have been paying increasingly more attention to DeFi, and this trend was most prominent in CNWE’s crypto sector, according to Chainlaysis.“CNWE’s transaction volume grew significantly across virtually all cryptocurrencies and service types, but especially on DeFi protocols. An influx of institutional investment, signaled by large transactions, drove most of the growth, though retail activity also increased,” the researchers noted.For example, the combined value of large institutional-sized transactions—i.e. transfers worth $10 million or more—reportedly grew from $1.4 billion in July 2020 to $46.3 billion in June 2021, making up more than 50% of all CNWE activity.The data shows that over the last 12 months, the majority of large institutional-sized transfers went to DeFi platforms. Given that, it’s not surprising that the majority of those large institutional transfers were made in  (ETH) and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH), an ERC-20 token of equivalent value to Ethereum commonly used in DeFi protocols.“DeFi protocols represent three to four of the top five services in most months, with , Instadapp, and dYdX making frequent appearances.  and , meanwhile, remain the most popular centralized exchanges,” the researchers explained.In terms of value received, the United Kingdom leads by far among other CNWE countries. Over the past year, the U.K. received about $170 billion in crypto transactions, 49% of which was the value sent to DeFi.Apart from Britain, other EU countries such as France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland round out the top five in this regard, per the report.Ethereum and Wrapped Etherum became the most popular cryptocurrencies in almost every CNWE country, outpacing Bitcoin in terms of sheer volume. In the U.K., for example, Bitcoin makes up 27% of the total crypto transaction value while ETH and WETH made up 40%.“Overall, though, while there are small differences between the individual countries’ exact breakdown of activity, one thing is clear: CNWE has become the world’s biggest cryptocurrency market, and its growth over the last year was largely driven by institutional investors and other whales moving into DeFi,” the researchers concluded."

The tool lets artists and developers customize how their  collection is displayed and auctioned.“NFTs present a very unique opportunity for the millions of artists, makers and creators around the world,” said Adam Jeffries, the newly-appointed CEO of Metaplex Studios in a prepared statement. “For the first time, they will be empowered to take ownership of their content, how it’s distributed and how they’re compensated for it.” The Metaplex protocol has already powered over 2 million Solana (SOL) transactions from various NFT sales, including projects like the Degen Ape Academic and Aurory.  In addition to Jeffries, Metaplex Studios is growing out a board of advisors. Among them include Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at Coinshares, Chris Kalani, chief product officer at Phantom, and Dylan Macalinao, co-founder of Saber Labs. “This value proposition has already attracted 500 plus makers who want to launch an NFT marketplace on Metaplex and we are extremely excited to be the bridge that brings original, never-before-seen content to the metaverse,” Jeffries added. Solana taps rebirth of NFTsNFTs first burst onto the scene early this year, but after reporting over $2.5 billion in sales in the first half of 2021, the niched appeared to have run out of steam. However, NFTs have become resurgent since the summer, with a wide array of new projects generating attention once again. One Bored Ape NFT, for example, sold for $2.25 million worth of  earlier this month, while EtherRocks—yes, pictures of rocks—sold for over $100,000 in early August. Big brands have also bought into the NFT space, including Visa and Budweiser. "
2021-09-29T13:00:17,"NFL NFTs Will Be ‘Very Different’ Than NBA Top Shot, Says Dapper Labs",https://wp.decrypt.co/82153/dapper-labs-nfl-nfts-very-different-nba-top-shot/,"Following yesterday’s report about a planned  marketplace for the National Football League, NBA Top Shot creator Dapper Labs today confirmed the news, announcing a partnership with both the league itself and the NFL Players Association (NFLPA).The as-yet-unnamed NFL marketplace for NFT collectibles is expected to launch sometime during the current season, which ends in February 2022 with Super Bowl LVI. As with NBA Top Shot, the NFL marketplace will run on Dapper’s own Flow blockchain and focus on collectible NFT “moments” based on video highlights captured from real NFL games.An NFT is effectively a deed of ownership for a provably scarce digital item, and can represent still and animated images, video files, and plenty more. An NBA Top Shot moment wraps a video highlight with animated flourishes and an edition number, making it akin to a digital trading card. Based on Dapper’s announcement, the NFL marketplace will do much the same.“The NFL is certainly a holy grail in North America, and we're super, super lucky to partner with them, as well as the NFL Players’ Association through OneTeam Partners,” Dapper Labs Head of Partnerships Caty Tedman told Decrypt. “It came together really quick, but I think everyone has a lot of conviction that it has the potential to be huge.”Back in March, Tedman commented on the prospect of Dapper launching other sports marketplaces. At the time, she told Decrypt that Dapper couldn’t “just slap NFL players on NBA Top Shot and make it work,” for example, suggesting that more nuance is required to create an NFT experience that can resonate with a sports league’s fan base.Dapper’s NFL marketplace plans sound similar in approach to NBA Top Shot, with video-driven highlights sold as collectible NFT moments. However, when asked about it this week, Tedman told Decrypt that the NFL marketplace will take a different approach in terms of content focus, and be handled in a “very different way than we program Top Shot.”“The game is just so different. Notably, the NFL is played on a much more week-to-week basis,” said Tedman, who worked for the NFL from 2014 to 2016. “I think there's a lot of fun that we can have with highlighting what happened that week, but then cross-reference how historical footage and previous seasons have related to that.”Tedman also pointed to the much larger number of players on the field during NFL games as another variable, and suggested that Dapper won’t simply focus on the big offensive plays—like “Hail Mary” tosses and ridiculous end zone catches. Dapper also aims to show off strategic nuances of the game, she said, like what a quarterback sees when the offensive line provides a “phenomenal pocket” to throw from.The NFL marks the fourth sports NFT initiative for Dapper Labs. In addition to NBA Top Shot (which now includes WNBA too), the firm announced a partnership with UFC in early 2020 that has yet to bear fruit.Last week, the startup unveiled an NFT marketplace for the Spanish LaLiga soccer league while announcing a new $250 million funding round that values Dapper at $7.6 billion.NBA Top Shot helped introduce NFTs to mainstream audiences and sports fans alike earlier this year, when the marketplace saw hundreds of thousands of users flood in to buy, collect, and sell the digital collectibles. One Top Shot moment of Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James sold for $387,600 in April, for example.All told, NBA Top Shot has amassed more than $700 million worth of trading volume to date, according to data from CryptoSlam. However, the bulk of that volume came in February and March, with sales numbers trailing off in the months since. With less than $11 million in trading volume in September so far, it’s poised to be Top Shot’s weakest month yet in 2021.Whether the NFL audience takes to Dapper’s new NFT platform as ravenously as NBA fans did with Top Shot—which was overwhelmed with demand earlier this year—remains to be seen. The NBA is viewed as the most social media-savvy professional sports league, which may have bolstered its ability to sell digital collectibles to fans. Can the NFL repeat the feat?Asked about it, Tedman suggested that even if NFL fans don’t broadly prove to be as digitally inclined as NBA aficionados, there’s still potential for Dapper to introduce those fans to NFTs as a bridge into  and the wider crypto world.“I think about it [like]: How can we engage an NFL fan where they are? And how do we talk to them in a way that they can fall in love with this technology through this product?” she said. “NBA Top Shot was a perfect way for a basketball fan to enter this space, and I really hope that what we do with the NFL is the entry point for people. Once you're part of the NFT space, there's so many exciting things to explore.”"

2021-09-29T11:23:11,Tennessee Electricity Provider May Face Litigation for Bitcoin Mining Noise Pollution,https://wp.decrypt.co/82171/tennessee-electricity-provider-may-face-litigation-bitcoin-mining-noise-pollution/,"Electricity and internet provider BrightRidge, based in Washington County, Tennessee, has been warned by officials about a loud  mining facility operating on its grounds, per ABC Tri-Cities. The Bitcoin mining facility belonging to Red Dog Technologies is allegedly breaching a zoning code. This means that the BrightRidge property is exceeding its permissions—in this instance, noise permissions— for the location it is in. Kent Harris, commissioner for Washington County, reportedly said the letter demands that BrightRidge complies with the warning within 30 days. If not, he’s made clear that further legal action would be necessary. “I think that it should be shut down. Litigation is something nobody likes, but if it comes to that, that’s what it’s going to come to,” Harris reportedly said. According to ABC Tri-Cities, the Bitcoin mining facility has been generating complaints since earlier this year, after residents issued complaints about a “loud hum” coming from the facility itself. Bitcoin mining has become a controversial practice in recent months as its damage to the environment has become better understood. Bitcoin and the environmentNoise pollution is not the only problem facing residents living near a Bitcoin mining facility. Bitcoin mining has also been linked to negative environmental damage in nearby communities. In upstate New York, a Greenidge Generation Bitcoin mining facility has been accused of warming the Keuka Outlet—a stream of water that flows into Seneca Lake—a body of water that is vital for the livelihood of thousands of people. In an interview with Decrypt, Greenidge Generation’s then-CEO Dale Irwin defended the firm’s activity by appealing to the number of jobs created by the facility. Yet, Seneca Lake is a microcosm of a much larger issue. The Bitcoin network consumes an immense amount of electricity—oftentimes more than most of the world’s countries. Based on the best available data, the majority of the Bitcoin network is not powered by renewable energy, but by carbon-intensive fossil fuels. As a result, the Bitcoin network produces greenhouse gas emissions broadly equivalent to 60 billion pounds of burned coal, or 9 million homes’ average electricity consumption for a year. Due to the fact that Bitcoin mining machines are single-use machines with very short shelf lives, the industry also produces high levels of electrical waste or e-waste. According to a study by Alex de Vries, founder of the Digiconomist blog, Bitcoin mining currently produces the same amount of e-waste as the Netherlands. Per transaction, Bitcoin produces 272 grams of e-waste, which is equivalent to two iPhone 12 Mini cell phones or half an iPad. Given the mining industry’s track record, noise might be the least of Washington County’s concerns. "

Last week, the Chinese government reiterated its crypto ban from 2017, condemning digital assets yet again.Following the news, at least two major Ethereum mining pools announced that they are ceasing operations in the country. Earlier this year, Chinese crypto miners also left the country after the government cracked down on the sector in May.Musk on China's crackdownMusk pointed out that China’s actions in regard to cryptocurrencies could’ve been prompted by concerns about the growing shortage of electricity in the country.“Part of it may actually be due to electricity shortages in many parts of China. A lot of South China right now is having random power outages because the power demand is higher than expected,” Musk noted. “Crypto mining might be playing a role in that.”At the same time, he acknowledged that cryptocurrencies might have some other political and financial implications as well due to some of their inherent qualities.“I suppose cryptocurrency is fundamentally aimed at reducing the power of a centralized government. They don’t like that,” Musk concluded.Still, China hasn’t been alone in sending nervous ripples across the crypto industry lately. Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, similarly reiterated that it’s important for cryptocurrencies not to “undermine the stability of the system.”“I think it’s better to bring it inside the public policy framework and ensure that we address these important public policy goals,” he stated."

Elon Musk, the CEO of the world's largest electric car company as well as SpaceX, is well-known for pontificating on everything from the imagined predilections of Thai rescue divers to his beloved .This morning, he stepped onto the Twitter hamster wheel that secretly powers every Tesla and pounded out  on the matter: ""Hamster has mad skillz!!""Mr. Goxx, whose name nearly matches the Mt. Gox exchange that suffered massive losses after a hack and alleged malfeasance by its operator, ""chooses"" which cryptocurrency he will trade by running on a wheel that's been segmented into multiple assets. He then buys or sells that currency by running through one of two tunnels; everything is wired to a trade desk.This method has helped Mr. Goxx and his anonymous owners outperform the Dow Jones as well as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Depending on the exact trading time, Mr. Goxx appears to have just about matched Bitcoin, which has gained almost 20% since the rodent started.That's been enough to impress Musk. Game, after all, recognizes game. With over 60 million followers, a single tweet from the King of Crypto can move markets. The price of  slipped after Tesla stopped accepting the cryptocurrency for merchandise—only for Musk to repeatedly kick BTC while it lay on the ground.Not everyone has been praising Mr. Goxx, however. Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus, clearly jealous that he didn't foresee the growing importance of so-called ""meme rodents,"" tweeted, ""It's all just dart throwing.""Bullseye."

For his next game, Wright’s first in more than a decade, he’s embracing  with an experience centered on .“Proxi” is Wright’s first new video game project since 2008’s “Spore,” and it has the same kind of inventive streak as his past creations. It’s a simulation game driven by artificial intelligence, and it’s designed to take players on a journey of self-discovery aided and enhanced by true ownership of digital, in-game assets.Developed by Wright’s new team, Gallium Studios, “Proxi” starts with players creating a personal diorama of memories using thousands of in-game items. Eventually, it generates a user avatar and lets them interact with other players. Along the way, Gallium aims to help players “gain more insights about their subconscious,” according to today’s announcement.“Proxi” is focused in part on user-generated content—following a trend popularized by smash hit games like Roblox and Fortnite—but also NFT collectibles. An NFT acts like a receipt for a provably scarce digital item, and while it can represent things like images and video files, it can also be tied to individual video game items that can be resold to other users.In this case, “Proxi” will let users own their memory creations as NFTs, and even profit from the sale of user-created items within the game. According to Bloomberg, “virtually everything” in the game can take the form of an NFT that can be resold to other users.Gallium Studios has partnered with NFT gaming platform Forte to handle the blockchain integration and NFT functionality. Forte will let users purchase NFTs with U.S. dollars, and the service is platform-agnostic, which means it can work with various blockchains. Back in May, Forte raised $185 million in funding at a $1 billion valuation.“I've always considered the community and their efforts an integral part of my games’ experience,” said Wright, in a release. “With Forte’s blockchain platform, we now have a secure way to integrate and reward the community’s contributions.”“Proxi” is set to launch on mobile devices this fall. Decrypt has inquired about additional platforms for the game, but did not immediately hear back. Initial starter packs of NFT collectibles are available today at $10 or $50 apiece, based on the contents within.The NFT market exploded in early 2021 with $2.5 billion in total transaction volume in the first half of the year, although recent figures suggest a much larger tally for the third quarter alone. For example, leading marketplace OpenSea had more than $3.4 billion in trading volume in August alone, per Dune Analytics, with September’s volume currently at $2.75 billion.Gaming is poised to be a significant part of the expanding NFT industry. Ethereum-based monster-battling game Axie Infinity is the current market leader with more than $2.1 billion worth of NFT sales to date, plus there are many more crypto games on the horizon.The Sandbox, an online 3D metaverse game, is another upcoming Ethereum game with a lot of buzz, not to mention alliances with the likes of Snoop Dogg, The Walking Dead, Atari, and more."

BeePool said the closure came ""in response to the latest regulatory policies."" SparkPool also cited ""regulatory requirements.""According to data from the Etherscan block explorer, the two mining pools are responsible for over one-quarter of all ETH mined. Mining is the process by which transactions are processed and confirmed on the Ethereum network. People contribute computing power that helps secure the network; the more they provide, the better chance they have of winning the ETH that's doled out with each new block created. Mining pools work by letting people—as the name suggests—pool their computing power and share the rewards.The shutdown of China's two largest mining pools come amidst a renewed crackdown on cryptocurrency by Chinese authorities. Last week, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) circulated a notice that any activity involving crypto assets, including mining and trading, are against the law.The country has been progressively clamping down on crypto since 2017 when the PBoC prohibited financial institutions from conducting crypto transactions, but its efforts have ramped up of late. This past winter saw a major drop in  hashrate—a measure of computing power on the  that correlates to network security—as mining operations in areas with cheap electricity were told to pack up shop. In May, three major Chinese payments associations, including the China Banking Association, publicly repeated the PBoC ban in a prelude of what was to come. Just in the last several days, Alibaba—the Amazon of China—has said it would stop selling customized crypto mining equipment, while CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap—both of which provide up-to-the-minute crypto price data—have apparently been blocked by Chinese government censors. Major exchanges Binance and Huobi Global have already stopped registering mainland Chinese residents; Huobi has given current users until the end of the year to get off.The price of ETH has fallen sharply in the last 24 hours, declining 6.5% per CoinGecko. It now sits below $2,900. Bitcoin, too, has fallen 4.3% in the last day."

(ETH) has shed more than 6% of its value over the last 24 hours, currently sitting at a price of $2,861. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has bounced back from recent lows around $2,750 twice over the last week, but is trending downward again this morning.Competing platforms like  (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) have seen even larger declines over the last day. Both are dubbed “ killers” and seen as chief rivals to Ethereum’s dominance in the worlds of , peer-to-peer lending and trading, and —those crypto collectible tokens that have moved billions in value since the start of year.Solana is currently down nearly 10% over the last 24 hours at a price of $131. SOL climbed dramatically over the course of August and early September, rising from a price of just $35 on August 1 to an all-time peak above $213 earlier this month, per CoinGecko.However, a network outage that began on September 14 and lasted for more than 17 hours appeared to slow Solana’s upward momentum, on top of wider bearish market sentiment of late.Avalanche, also a big gainer in recent weeks, is down nearly 8% over the past day at a current price of $64. Like Solana, Avalanche has popped since the start of last month, rising from about $13 on August 1 to an all-time high above $79 on September 23.Likewise, Algorand (ALGO)—another challenger to Ethereum’s  dominance—is down more than 8% over the last 24 hours at $1.62. Alrogand likewise saw a significant pop in value in recent weeks, even doubling in value over the course of two days earlier this month.Not every notable cryptocurrency is taking hits this hard today.  is down less than 4% over the last 24 hours at a current price of $41,634, for example, while  (DOGE) has shed just over 2% at a price slightly below $0.20.Today’s crypto market declines may be tied into rising bearish sentiment amongst investors. Today, the Conference Board announced that the Consumer Confidence Index has dropped further, suggesting increasing caution in spending amidst continued COVID-19 concerns.The stock market is also down this morning, with the NASDAQ dropping more than 2% and the S&P 500 and Dow seeing less severe declines.This morning’s accelerated crypto market declines have also come during testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Janet Yellen, the United States Secretary of Treasury.

Shortly after, the mining pool has returned the erroneous fee back to Bitfinex’s wallet via three transactions of 1 ETH, 7,385 ETH, and 240 ETH, respectively.While the mining pool that received the enormous gas fee is anonymous, it is currently ranked 9th among the largest Ethereum miners and is responsible for roughly 3.1% of the network’s hash rate, according to Etherscan.“Thank you to the miner of block 13307440 who we can confirm is returning 7,626 ETH that were incorrectly paid today as a tx fee,” decentralized crypto exchange () DeversiFi tweeted.DeversiFi was previously known as Ethfinex, a sister exchange of crypto trading platform Bitfinex. In 2019, the two firms parted company via a “management buyout” and Ethfinex was rebranded into DeversiFi. Notably, the three co-founders of the DEX also worked at Bitfinex in the past, as per Bloomberg.The connection doesn’t stop there, however. Due to yesterday’s events, it has now become clear that the DEX also has access to at least one of Bitfinex’s crypto wallets to help subside transaction costs for users.Transaction error: Bitfinex or DeversiFi?“At 11:10 UTC on the 27th September a deposit transaction was made using a hardware wallet from the main DeversiFi user interface with an erroneously high gas fee,” the DEX later acknowledged on Twitter.A spokesperson for Bitfinex also confirmed to  that the transaction in question “belongs to DeversiFi.”“This transaction was a transaction to deposit funds on the DeversiFi L2 solution.

A newly launched professional network aims to help people reconnect and thrive in the industry. And it just so happens to be led by 25 women.Crypto Connect, a ""decentralized organization,"" is launching today in 12 U.S. cities, with plans to quickly expand. Its chapter leads include Future Perfect Ventures founder Jalak Jobanputra in Miami; Aubrey Strobel, head of communications for Bitcoin rewards company Lolli, in New York; and Association for Digital Asset Markets CEO Michelle Bond in Washington, D.C. Board members include journalists Leigh Cuen and Naomi Brockwell, as well as Penn State law professor Tonya Evans. Podcaster Layah Heilpern and Chamber of Digital Commerce Chief Policy Officer Teana Baker-Taylor will help build out the group's international presence.While the nonprofit is led by some of the most active women in the space, it's for everyone working within the crypto space. ""The point of Crypto Connect is really to be a resource to connect successful individuals in the industry regardless of background, gender or anything like that,"" Crypto Connect founder and president Hailey Lennon told Decrypt.Lennon, a partner at prominent crypto law firm Anderson Kill, said the organization was borne out of her own experience traveling during COVID—as government quarantines and corporate work-from-home policies combined to make hotel conferences and happy hours nearly obsolete. ""I felt like my ability to ping into different communities and different cities as I traveled started to deteriorate and it made it harder to travel and network and continue getting to know people,"" she said.Over the last several months, she's tapped her network to jumpstart the nonprofit, which promises both in-person meetups and online webinars and educational seminars. By joining the database, members will also have access to referrals and mentoring.The group's representation is balanced, meaning just about anyone in the larger crypto community should be able to find resources via someone in a similar sector. There are lawyers and marketers, investors and engineers, journalists and academics. ""Having the various backgrounds and expertise on the board allowed us to mobilize very quickly,"" said Lennon.Membership is free and open to all within the industry. And, if men see the project's leadership and think, somehow, that it's not for them, Lennon assures them that's not the case. ""I actually think that men and women benefit more from networking when gender isn't the issue or topic,"" she said, ""but I also think it's important for women to see female-led initiatives and know that that's more than possible and should be more common."""
2021-09-28T13:00:11,"The Problem with TVL, DeFi's Favorite Metric",https://wp.decrypt.co/82024/problem-with-tvl-total-value-locked-defi-metric/,"The crypto world loves to talk TVL. Short for “total value locked,” the term became ubiquitous during the  boom of the last two years, and represents the total financial value locked up in smart contracts.The reason TVL is on everyone’s lips is because it shows just how fast DeFi has grown. In early 2020, total TVL for Ethereum DeFi stood at barely $1 billion—while today the estimate is north of $80 billion, . This means there’s a staggering amount of liquidity in DeFi pools where investors and others go to earn yield. This sounds like a good thing for crypto and DeFi—and, by and large, it has been. But the TVL bonanza hasn’t been so great for everyone.It turns out that the largest liquidity pools, those with high TVL, pose a drawback for a key group of people: small investors. The reason has to do with how those investors pay to interact with liquidity pools.First, let’s step back to recall how exactly DeFi transactions works.  (DEXs) enable users to swap crypto assets without an intermediary. While centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance use order books to match buyers with sellers, DEXs maintain standing ""liquidity pools"" of crypto tokens locked in a smart contract that facilitates trades with both buyers and sellers. Traders pay a fee for every trade, which returns a yield to the liquidity providers. Conventional wisdom is that the more liquidity, the better for traders, but that’s not always the case.The first factor to consider is slippage, or the difference between the price at which a buyer places a market order—and the price that they actually pay. In centralized exchanges, there are two reasons for slippage: market volatility—prices moving around—and insufficient order depth. In the latter case, there is just not enough volume to fill the entire order at the requested price, so part of it gets filled at a higher price. In DEXs, the concept of slippage is similar, but is simply a function of TVL. The other price factor to consider after slippage is fees. Capital always expects a return, so liquidity providers (LPs) who provide large amounts of TVL need to be paid yield. The more liquidity they provide, the more they need to be paid—and their fees are included in the user’s price. The size of each liquidity pool within a DEX has a direct impact on the exchange’s fees. Generally, smaller pools incur lower fees but lead to more slippage. Conversely, larger pools require higher fees but result in less slippage. Crucially, the relationship is non-linear. For example, a $10,000 trade in a $10 million pool may have 10 basis points (bps) of slippage, plus fees to compensate LPs. The same $10,000 trade in a $1 billion pool has essentially zero slippage. But if trade volume is not significantly higher than in the $10 million pool, transaction fees would need to be much higher to generate a similar yield for LPs in a pool with 1,000 times the capital. As a result, larger pools end up benefiting larger trades and negatively impacting smaller trades. Thus, more liquidity tends to hurt retail traders, who constitute the largest DeFi user base and generally place trades of less than $10,000. Why, then, do most DeFi projects seekto attract as much liquidity as possible? Most likely this is marketing: big numbers draw more eyeballs. That is not totally wrong-headed, as more liquidity does have the potential to attract more trade volume, which in turn could off-set the need to increase fees to meet the required yield. But this tends to hold true only up to a point. This is why our DEX Of course, not every DEX should cater to retail traders, and high liquidity is not inherently a bad thing. But the DeFi community’s growing obsession with attaining the highest possible liquidity is adversely affecting the vast majority of its users. The resulting dynamic echoes one of the most problematic aspects of traditional finance, in which, for example, customers with relatively small checking accounts pay the fees that enable banks to offer free services and cut-rate mortgages to wealthy clients. Retail users should not be subsidizing whales.DeFi’s obsession with the greatest possible TVL has the potential to recreate the same financial system that drove so many to crypto in the first place. DeFi protocols and exchanges can and should be more deliberately designed, even custom-built for specific user profiles. The innovative and open-minded DeFi community is more than capable of creating thoughtful solutions for everyone and fully entering the mainstream. In order to build a better financial system, we need to stop focusing on higher liquidity, and start focusing on what really matters: users. The large increase in TVL over the past year shows that the model works, but the next frontier ought to be capital efficiency."
2021-09-28T12:55:04,"Far-Right Activists Raise Millions in Bitcoin, Monero: AP",https://wp.decrypt.co/82086/far-right-activists-raise-millions-bitcoin-monero-ap/,"Far-right activists are raising millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency, according to an Associated Press (AP) investigation. One of the chief beneficiaries of cryptocurrency donations is Andrew Anglin, founder of the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer. “The Daily Stormer website advocates for the purity of the white race, posts hate-filled, conspiratorial screeds against Blacks, Jews and women and has helped inspire at least three racially motivated murders. It has also made its founder, Andrew Anglin, a millionaire,” the AP said. Per the AP, Anglin has received at least 112  since January 2017. By today’s prices, that is worth approximately $4.8 million. The AP investigation does suggest, however, that “he’s likely raised even more.”Despite his vast sums of Bitcoin, Anglin remains a ghost. According to voting records, Anglin was in Russia in 2016 and his passport reportedly shows him in Cambodia in 2017. Since then, however, “the public trail goes cold,” the AP said, adding that he has no obvious bank accounts of real estate holdings in the United States. As a result, it has become increasingly difficult to stamp out Anglin’s presence from digital and political life. “We were able to sue the Ku Klux clan, a terrorist organization, in essence out of existence,” said Beth Littrell, a lawyer for the Southern Poverty Law Center which assists one of Anglin’s victims. She reportedly said that doing the same today is much harder. Anglin’s love affair with BitcoinAnglin was stacking Bitcoin during the Charlottesville riots in August 2017, one of the United States’ most infamous days in recent history.Per the AP, Anglin received 14.88 Bitcoin one week after the events in Charlottesville—an amount worth approximately $60,000 at the time. To date, this has been Anglin’s biggest donation, especially after being cut off by credit card processors and banned by PayPal, hence his reliance on Bitcoin. Anglin’s love affair with Bitcoin continued well after Charlottesville. In 2020, he published a guide called “Retard’s Guide to Using Bitcoin,” in which he claimed to have funded The Daily Stormer for four years using only Bitcoin. “When you are caught having the wrong opinion, they will take it upon themselves to shut you out of this system, making your life very difficult. One alternative to this system is cryptocurrency,” reportedly said a Telegram user in a white nationalist cryptocurrency guide. Anglin, the AP continues, is just one of a wider web of far-right activists that are tapping into crypto fundraising. The AP cites Chainalysis data that sampled 12 far-right entities in the U.S. and Europe that requested Bitcoin donations. Those groups reportedly received 213 Bitcoin—over $9 million by today’s prices—between January 2017 and April 2021. Earlier this year, a Chainalysis report found that the Capitol Hill riots of January 6 may have also been partly financed by Bitcoin. One month before the riots, a donor sent $522,000 worth of Bitcoin to 22 separate addresses controlled by “far-right activists and internet personalities.” The donor, now deceased, said he cared about what happened after his death, which was why he left his wealth to “certain causes and people.”  The far-right pivots to MoneroIn February of 2021, Anglin reportedly abandoned Bitcoin, instructing followers to use the privacy-centric cryptocurrency  for future donations instead. “Every Bitcoin transfer is visible publicly. Generally, your name is not attached to the address in a direct way, but spies from the various ‘woke’ anti-freedom organizations have unlimited resources to try to link these transactions to real names,” Anglin said, adding that with Monero, “all transactions are hidden.”Anglin is not the only far-right activist pivoting to Monero. Jaz Searby, who previously headed an Australian branch of the Proud Boys extremist organization is reportedly seeking Monero—and only Monero—in order to “spread our message to a generation of young Aryan men.” The Nordic Resistance Movement (NRM), another far-right organization, is yet another player in the crypto game, even reportedly letting supporters mine Monero directly on the group’s behalf. “Do you really think how we operate our economy is any of your business?” Maxim Saxlin, editor of the NRM’s Nordfront magazine reportedly asked AP in an email. Monero has already been embroiled in other criminal investigations, too. In Norway, law enforcement has tried to crack the privacy coin in the hopes of aiding the hunt for Anne-Elisabeth Hagen who disappeared in October 2018. According to the AP, the world’s financial regulators are starting to wise up to the risks posed by cryptocurrencies, specifically the challenges posed by unhosted wallets. With that said, the road ahead is a long one. “The problem with an unhosted wallet is what’s your pain point? The only thing we have is civil contempt of criminal conviction. If someone is willing to sit in jail and the money is theirs on the other side because no one can access it, that’s a problem,” reportedly said Amanda Wick, a previous senior policy advisor for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network before joining Chainlaysis as chief of legal affairs.

Journalists who report basic facts are accused of spreading ""FUD,"" they get hammered for perceived biases, and they must work in an Internet economy that often rewards speed over accuracy.They also get arrested, beat up, and even killed for trying to reveal the truth. According to the Freedom of the Press Foundation, on-the-job journalist arrests increased 1200% in the U.S. in 2020, while twenty-one journalists worldwide were murdered because of their work. The FPF is a group that seeks to protect journalists' freedom of speech—and now it has a new way to do so, namely  Web 3 tools. On Tuesday, the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW) announced it is giving FPF $5.8 million to build out its SecureDrop tool with ""zero-trust architecture.""SecureDrop is open-source software developed by FPF in 2013. It allows journalists and sources, especially whistleblowers who are at risk of arrest or violence, to communicate with one another via Tor. It's used by The New Yorker,  and The Washington Post, just to name a few.The FFDW grant will go toward exploring improvements for the SecureDrop system and, hopefully, to make the foundation's databases of government data and press freedom violations extra-impenetrable. For instance, the FPF maintains its own archive of news websites that have been shut down, but it would like to take the next step of publishing these on a censorship-resistant platform. And it wants to see how it can leverage the best of what blockchain has built to keep privacy tools ahead of governments.“With this grant, by far the largest our organization has ever received, we’ll be able to speed the introduction of new upgrades and features to SecureDrop and spur its adoption worldwide,” said FPF Executive Director Trevor Timm in a press release.This is the sort of use case Filecoin was made for. It's a storage service run on a decentralized protocol so that people and institutions can rent out or lease space on other people's computers. But instead of all that press data living on a reporter's laptop down the road, Filecoin splits up files and distributes them across servers. It's all about privacy.""Our mission is to permanently preserve humanity's most important information,"" said FFDW board chair Marta Belcher. ""FPF's efforts are a natural fit for collaboration."""

The bill would require the Treasury Department to report to Congress on how cryptocurrencies are being used—and mined—in foreign nations, including how they impact supply chains and technologies like semiconductors. “In order to strengthen U.S. competitiveness, our government must get a better handle on the role that cryptocurrency is playing in the global economy and how it is being leveraged by other countries,” Senator Hassan said. This is not the first time Senator Hassan has directed federal attention to the crypto industry.Earlier this month, she called on the Treasury Department—as well as other federal agencies—to address how cryptocurrencies facilitate criminal activity like cyberattacks. The Treasury Department has since announced actions designed to counter ransomware. “As cybercriminals use increasingly sophisticated methods and technology, we are committed to using the full range of measures, to include sanctions and regulatory tools, to disrupt, deter, and prevent ransomware attacks,” said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen at the time.To get the latest crypto-mining bill across the line, Senator Hassan is also joined by Republican Senator Ernst. The two are also working together to build a war memorial in Washington D.C. “I’m glad to partner across the aisle with Senator Ernst to help ensure that the Treasury Department stays on top of the use of cryptocurrency, including how it can impact our supply chains,” she added.The geopolitics of crypto miningThe bipartisan bill has been introduced at a time when the geopolitics of crypto mining is at a crossroads. With one eye on its climate commitments, China announced a ban on cryptocurrency mining earlier this year. Before the ban, China enjoyed approximately two-thirds of the world’s total mining industry. Since, there have been multiplereports of miners exiting the country to resume operations elsewhere, leaving the crypto industry to speculate on who will become the next crypto mining powerhouse. While there is no reliable data on the world’s mining map since April, the U.S. has begun making room for the mining industry. In Texas, mining companies like Riot and Argo Blockchain have spent millions on land to launch  mining operations. BIT Mining Limited—a Chinese firm—also invested $25 million in a crypto mining center in the Lonestar State this May. In upstate New York, Greenidge Generation’s Bitcoin mining facility mines about 4 Bitcoin per day, despite outcry from environmentalists. Wyoming has also passed bill after bill in a push to become America’s blockchain state. The latest bill also shows that crypto companies aren't the only ones interested in turning the U.S. into a mining hub."

Just tonight, in fact, he spent nearly $4 million in ETH to acquire a single piece from the artist XCOPY.Using his NFT-collecting alias, Cozomo de Medici, Snoop purchased the animated Ethereum NFT “Some Asshole” by XCOPY for 1,300 ETH on the SuperRare marketplace. That’s just shy of $3.9 million worth of ETH.“Welcome ‘Some Asshole’ to the Medici villa. Let's hope he's polite at Nonna's Sunday dinner,” Cozomo tweeted soon after. “Honored to acquire XCOPY's 1st published character piece & #7 mint on SuperRare.”XCOPY’s artwork has increasingly become a blue chip in the NFT artwork world. Just last week, an unidentified buyer spent 1,000 ETH ($2.92 million) on another XCOPY piece called “All Time High in the City,” per data from DappRadar.According to SuperRare, Snoop’s new XCOPY NFT was previously sold for just 100 ETH in March, back when that was worth about $181,000. Before that, it sold for 25 ETH (about $8,200) in September 2020.An NFT acts like a receipt for a rare digital item, as verified by a . XCOPY specializes in animated images, but an NFT can also represent still artwork, video files, interactive video game items, and nearly any other kind of digital good.Last week, Snoop Dogg revealed that he has been amassing a valuable collection of NFT collectibles under the alias Cozomo de’ Medici, who joined Twitter in August.Cozomo has a valuable collection indeed, with an estimated value of more than $17 million as of last week, thanks to owning several CryptoPunks, many Art Blocks NFTs, and plenty more.Since his initial reveal, Snoop has announced a collaboration with The Sandbox, an upcoming Ethereum-based metaverse game. Snoop will have a custom-designed area in the game and host a private party for NFT pass holders, including an in-game concert.The Sandbox will also sell other Snoop-themed NFTs, including playable avatars that look like him, as well as customizable LAND plots that are adjacent to Snoop’s own terrain."

2021-09-27T21:05:13,Facebook Is Spending $50 Million to Build Metaverse—'Responsibly',https://wp.decrypt.co/82044/facebook-50-million-build-metaverse-responsibly/,"Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in June that the social media giant is on a path to become “a metaverse company.” Now the firm is putting its money where its mouth is, revealing plans to spend $50 million over the next two years to help bring the metaverse to life.Today, Facebook announced the XR Programs and Research Fund, a two-year initiative to fund both its own projects and external research as the firm explores the future of online social interactions. It’s a “starting point” for Facebook, per the announcement, as it attempts to co-create the future online metaverse.What is the metaverse? It’s a term that we hear often in the crypto industry, especially as decentralized projects attempt to create future online worlds and experiences free from the oversight and control of centralized entities—like Facebook, for example.Essentially, the metaverse refers to shared online spaces in which users—represented by 3D avatars—coexist and interact together. It has been represented in such media as “Snow Crash” and “Ready Player One,” and Ethereum-based metaverse worlds such as Decentraland (shown above) and CryptoVoxels already exist. Upcoming game The Sandbox is another prominent example.Along with opening the door to new social and gaming experiences, metaverse advocates believe that it will also help change the nature of work, and afford new digital economic opportunities to users around the world. It’s similar in a sense to how DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations, are being built to disrupt traditional companies.It’s heady, potentially revolutionary stuff—which is why some metaverse builders bristle at the prospect of Facebook trying to lead the charge in metaverse development. Apparently aware of criticism of its track record on user privacy and cultivating misinformation, Facebook said today that it will build metaverse products “responsibly” via this initiative.“We’ll work with experts in government, industry, and academia to think through issues and opportunities in the metaverse,” reads the official post. “For instance, its success depends on building robust interoperability across services, so different companies’ experiences can work together. We also need to involve the human rights and civil rights communities from the start to ensure these technologies are built in a way that’s inclusive and empowering.”Facebook’s initial partners in the $50 million initiative include the Organization of American States, Women in Immersive Tech, and African organizations Electric South, Africa No Filter, and Imisi3D. The firm will also consult with researchers at Seoul National University, The University of Hong Kong, and the National University of Singapore on these efforts.However these early efforts take shape, Facebook has already signaled that it doesn’t intend to single-handedly create or oversee the eventual metaverse. And this will probably only be the beginning of a long-term process.“The metaverse isn’t a single product one company can build alone,” the firm writes. “Just like the internet, the metaverse exists whether Facebook is there or not. And it won’t be built overnight. Many of these products will only be fully realized in the next 10-15 years.”"

Morgan Stanley analyst Ken Zerbe thinks SI stock is severely undervalued at its current $109 trading price. By his reckoning, $158 would be more accurate—with the potential for $300, though he recognized there's a risk it could fall as low as $40.In the past 24 hours, the price of SI stock has increased by 6.5%.""We believe Silvergate should be valued based on its earnings growth (similar to other faster-growing financials), rather than being compared against more traditional and slower-growing banks, particularly given its minimal credit risk as its [held-for-investment] loan portfolio is just 6% of earning assets,"" Zerbe wrote.He makes several cases in Silvergate's favor. First, the company's Silvergate Exchange Network allows customers to deposit funds with the bank and then transfer in and out of digital currencies. While it doesn't pay depositors interest, Morgan Stanley sees this as a positive. It's plain easier for customers to move funds but can avoid the scrutiny from securities regulators that has greeted high-interest lenders such as BlockFi and Celsius—not to mention , which scuttled its own Lend project to avoid a standoff with the SEC.Silvergate does, however, issue loans backed by Bitcoin—and it's done so over the past year without posting losses or needing to liquidate customers' positions. Morgan Stanley thinks loan demand will grow but that only a small fraction of loans will be held for investment. That's a good thing. ""Unlike most other banks, loan growth is not a meaningful driver of earnings growth (but deposit growth is), implying far less credit risk at Silvergate than most other banks,"" wrote Morgan Stanley.Though Zerbe noted the risks to cryptocurrency markets, such as regulation and price volatility, that's outweighed by a boom in demand for crypto services: ""Silvergate gives bank investors a nearly pure-play way to participate in the rapid growth of the nascent cryptocurrency industry.""Silvergate also stands to benefit from its relationship with Facebook's Diem project. In May, the Diem Association announced that Silvergate would be the sole issuer of its stablecoins.Morgan Stanley has been inclined toward SI since before then. In March, it introduced its cryptocurrency exposure basket, which featured Silvergate stock along with MicroStrategy, Square, Riot Blockchain, and Nvidia (but no Tesla).That all adds up to Morgan Stanley giving the stock an ""overweight"" rating, meaning it thinks the stock price will do better than industry competitors. As Morgan Stanley puts it, ""Silvergate is unlike any other bank we cover, and that could be a very good thing."""

And now with the advent of NFTs, he plans to bring some of those formative early machines into homes as digital, augmented reality collectibles.Today, Bushnell and NFT marketplace MakersPlace announced The Arcade OG Series, a set of Ethereum-based collectibles. An  is a  that can be used to prove ownership of a verifiably scarce digital item—in this case, a video clip displaying a 3D rendering of an Atari “Pong” or Syzygy (Bushnell’s Atari precursor) “Computer Space” arcade game cabinet.Each Arcade OG Series collectible is more than just a simple video clip, however: it also comes with an augmented reality experience that lets you view the 3D rendering of the arcade cabinet within any real-world space. Owners will be able to drop the digital cabinet into place and then walk around it, viewing it up-close from all angles.Augmented reality experiences typically use your smartphone or tablet’s cameras and sensors to display your real-world surroundings with digital elements on top. Some mobile apps use the technology for interactive games and shopping experiences. NFT marketplace Veve—which works with brands like Marvel and Star Trek—also offers 3D “digital statues” that you can view on a screen set against your real-world backdrop.The Arcade OG Series is a collaboration between Bushnell and artist Zai Ortiz, a 3D designer who worked on films like “Iron Man 2” and “Tron Legacy,” as well as video games. The pair previously partnered on “St. Noire,” a murder mystery board game powered by Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant.The NFT project spans five different collectibles, each depicting a different arcade cabinet. According to a report from Bloomberg, some of the NFTs will be available in open editions for anyone to purchase at a fixed price during the available time frame, beginning on October 12.Meanwhile, others will be single-edition collectibles that are auctioned to the highest bidder with bonus perks included. For example, a single-edition red “Pong” NFT will be paired with a visit with Bushnell to the Two Bit Circus arcade and entertainment center in Los Angeles, while a yellow “Computer Space” NFT will come with a signed and unopened Atari 2600 game console.Bushnell plans to further explore the NFT space with future projects, telling Bloomberg, “I hope we can blow your socks off every six months with a new sock-blower-offer.”Atari’s logo is featured on the NFT project’s official website, although the classic gaming brand’s level of involvement is currently unclear. Decrypt has reached out to MakersPlace for clarification on that point and other details. We will update this article if we hear back.Since last year, Atari has charted its own course throughout the crypto world, launching a number of initiatives including the -based Atari Token and an array of licensed NFT collectibles. The brand also announced plans to launch an online cryptocurrency casino and new crypto-tinged versions of classic games, the latter in partnership with Animoca Brands.However, Atari’s crypto plans may have pivoted. Recently, the Atari Token Twitter account is primarily focused on an upcoming Atari 3D online metaverse experience called Alphaverse. Meanwhile, at a current price under $0.06, the Atari Token has shed nearly 93% of its value since peaking in May, per data from CoinGecko. Unlike many top cryptocurrencies, Atari Token has shown no sustained sign of rebounding from the market-wide summer slump.Atari’s new VCS, a hybrid home PC and game console with blockchain and crypto tie-ins, launched this year to mostly middling reviews from tech and gaming publications.In its latest annual results report from August, Atari called the fiscal year ending on March 31, 2021 a “transition year,” and said that it had generated more than $1 million in sales from NFTs on partnered platforms. The firm plans to launch its own video game-centric NFT marketplace as well."

For example, who’s holding the private keys to these Bitcoin?"" Nolvia Serrano, head of operations at crypto wallet provider BlockBank, asked on the  podcast on Monday. ""Also, what’s the criteria for saying, 'Oh, today, we’re going to buy more Bitcoin, or we’re going to wait until next month.' We don’t know that.""On September 6, one day before Bitcoin officially became legal tender in the country, Bukele’s regime purchased 400 Bitcoin. Each purchase is a risk for the country's treasury, considering Bitcoin's price volatility. At that time, Bitcoin was trading at $53,000; one day later, it . Not to be dissuaded, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele “bought the dip” last week, and increased El Salvador’s total holdings to 700 Bitcoin while Salvadorans continue to ask questions. “Are they planning on purchasing more?"" Serrano asked, adding, “what is this process, who is controlling this, who is overseeing this?” Transparency issuesEl Salvador’s private keys are not the only part of the government’s Bitcoin embrace that’s generating questions. Serrano also said that the government has not disclosed the criteria for choosing providers for the Chivo wallet. “All these answers are being demanded by Salvadorans,” she added. Serrano did not go as far as to outrightly accuse President Bukele’s government of hiding information from the public, but pointed out the obvious tension between Bitcoiners’ commitment to transparency and the lack of public information surrounding the government’s Bitcoin policy. “There’s no space to make wrong calls on this, and we need to be transparent because the cryptocurrency community cares about these principles,” Serrano said. She added that if El Salvador’s government demonstrates “something that is completely separate from the ideas of Bitcoin, then you’re not going to have the Bitcoin community supporting you.” That has not so far been true, given that some of the world’s loudest Bitcoiners—like Jack Mallers, Michael Saylor and Peter McCormack—have all heaped praise on President Bukele ever since he announced his  at the Bitcoin Miami conference. On the other hand, many Salvadorans have vocally opposed the policy. In July, a survey commissioned by the Center for Citizen Studies at Francisco Gavidia University found that 77% of Salvadorans believed Bukele’s Bitcoin Law was “not a wise move.” A second survey, this time conducted by the Central American University in September, found that over two thirds (67%) of respondents disagreed—or strongly disagreed—with Bitcoin becoming legal tender in El Salvador. Bukele's flag-wavers vs his criticsBetween the Bitcoin influencers who have cheered Bukele and the skeptics who have called the experiment into question, Serrano says the truth lies somewhere in the middle. ""There is a point in the middle,"" she said, ""between the FUD–people saying —but also [the claim] that  are already using Bitcoin for transactions. It's the point in the middle.""El Salvador has also seen protest after protest after protest against the Bitcoin Law, with signs that said “no al lavado de dinero corrupto,” and “no al Bitcoin,” which mean “no to laundering corrupt money,” and “no to Bitcoin.” While there was undoubtedly a strong anti-Bitcoin motivation for El Salvador’s recent protests, Serrano also points out it was not the only factor. “Some were protesting against what they claim is authoritarianism and dictatorship, because [Bukele] is controlling the Congress, he pretty much has a lot of power in the country,” she said. Earlier this summer, El Salvador’s courts made it possible for a president to serve consecutive terms. While the decision was criticized as unconstitutional by the United States and other foreign powers, it offered an insight into Bukele’s dictatorial streak, which has also bled into the country’s Bitcoin politics.“It crushes my soul to see Bitcoin maximalists around the world cheering this when, if they actually sat down and read the law and regulations, it is completely opposite to everything they preach,” one local businessperson recently told Decrypt on condition of anonymity.

With more money and wider interest have come smarter tools, and crypto analytics firm Nansen has emerged as a popular resource for NFT collectors.In a viral tweet thread, Twitter user MEV Collector called Nansen his “most used tool for following smart money buys” and detailed NFT buys and sales that turned a roughly 11 ETH initial investment (about $42,800 then) into 862 ETH ($3.35 million) of net value in just over a month.That’s just one example, but Nansen has increasingly been touted amongst collectors as a way to spot the hot NFT trends before they hit social media. An NFT acts like a deed of ownership to a provably scarce digital item, with popular types of collectibles including avatars, generative artwork, and interactive video game items.CEO Alex Svanevik explained Nansen’s approach to Decrypt this week during the Messari Mainnet conference, describing how the firm “enriches” on-chain data with public  labels. That helps customers understand who’s buying and selling, which NFT collections are popping, and who’s making the most profit from flipping tokenized jpegs.“That gives you a perspective of the market that makes it easier to understand what’s happening on the ,” Svanevik said.He described Nansen’s ethos of highlighting “smart money” investments, echoing the phrase from MEV Collector above, as a reason for launching the NFT Leaderboard feature in July. Essentially, the NFT Leaderboard curates and ranks crypto wallets based on how much money they’ve made from flipping NFTs.""[The NFT Leaderboard] caused a bit of a stir because you saw that many of these influencers on Twitter are actually quite successful if you look at the on-chain metrics, and how they have generated profits,” he said. “You can look at it from two perspectives: one is that they're shilling these different collections, but at the same time they're building a lot of exposure for them.”Nansen’s NFT Leaderboard is focused on the profit spread between money spent buying NFTs and the revenue generated from selling them. Other wallets might hold NFTs with a higher overall estimated value, but value is relative: it’s not real until the NFT is sold.In any case, the ranking provides a look at who’s making the most cash by reselling NFTs, and may provide a glimpse at trends and strategies for anyone fixed on becoming the next Pranksy.Svanevik, decked out in a Pudgy Penguins t-shirt at Messari Mainnet—one of many Decrypt interviewees with NFT avatar apparel—suggests that NFTs are “underrated” right now. Some people may grimace at the amount of money spent on NFTs along with other concerns, but in Svanevik’s view, their allure is key to bringing more people into the crypto industry."" has brought the capital into crypto, and NFTs are bringing the people into crypto,” he said. “If you ask a normal person about finance—they don't care about finance, so why would they care about decentralized finance? But if you ask them about music, art, entertainment, or gaming, there's a lot of people who are really passionate about these topics.”He pointed to Ethereum-based monster-battling game Axie Infinity—which has sold more than $2 billion worth of NFTs to date—and the expanding crypto gaming scene as a key driver for future momentum, and suggested that there’s plenty of room for NFTs to grow.“We've only scratched the surface on NFTs,” Svanevik said. “They’re going to be massive.”"

Berman later alleged that Griffith “provided highly technical information to North Korea, knowing that this information could be used to help North Korea launder money and evade sanctions.”“Griffith jeopardized the sanctions that both Congress and the president have enacted to place maximum pressure on North Korea’s dangerous regime,” Berman explained.Apart from giving “valuable information” to the North Korean audience, Griffith also entered the country in April 2019 without approval from the U.S.—despite being warned about traveling to the country, the criminal complaint also alleged.In their turn, Griffith’s lawyers previously argued that the information he provided does not qualify as “service” and can be easily obtained by anyone on the internet, therefore his speech was protected by the First Amendment.Since Griffith’s arrest, the crypto community has seemingly split on the subject, with some arguing that his actions were ill-advised. Nonetheless,  co-founder Vitalik Buterin was among those who voiced their support for Griffith in 2019.“I refuse to take the convenient path of throwing Virgil under the bus, because I firmly believe that that would be wrong,” Buterin tweeted at the time.Meanwhile, a petition to release Griffith from prison, published two years ago, has garnered only 516 signatures so far."
2021-09-27T12:43:15,"Canadian Regulators Warn Against Misleading, ‘Gambling-style’ Crypto Ads",https://wp.decrypt.co/81978/canadian-regulators-warn-against-misleading-gambling-style-crypto-ads/,"Canadian financial regulators, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC), have published a joint guidance letter to remind crypto trading platforms about the importance of “requirements relating to advertising, marketing, and social media use.”In the document published last Thursday, the regulators outlined the three main areas of concern: ads and marketing materials that “could be considered false or misleading,” the use of gambling-style contests, promotions, or schemes, and “compliance and supervisory challenges” of using social media platforms for advertisements.First and foremost, the notice was addressed to crypto platforms that are either already registered (or filed an application) as a dealer under securities legislation or are considering doing so in the future.Notably, while these requirements mostly involve trading of digital assets that are considered securities, they can also potentially apply to “crypto assets that are commodities, because the user’s contractual right relating to the crypto asset may itself constitute a security and/or a derivative,” the document stated.Canadian regulators put stop to FOMO“We have recently noted some [crypto platforms] using advertising or marketing strategies that include contests, promotions, bonuses and time limits to encourage investors to engage in trading and to act quickly for fear of missing out on an investment opportunity or a reward,” the regulators pointed out.For example, a “gambling-style” promotion could involve bonus schemes that “may offer a financial reward or a bonus interest in a particular type of crypto asset for the first 500 investors who take an action within the next 24 hours.”Because of this, crypto platforms should remember that they “have an important role as gatekeepers of the integrity of the capital markets,” according to the regulator.The notice added that marketing campaigns that promote this kind of “risky trading” may also be in violation of the platforms’ “obligation to treat clients fairly, honestly and in good faith.”At the same time, “misleading” advertisements may include statements that suggest that a certain crypto platform is “registered under securities legislation where this is not the case” or that a platform was approved—or even endorsed—by a regulatory authority.To these ends, the president and CEO of the IIROC, Andrew Kriegler, said his organization “will continue to work closely with the CSA to ensure investors are protected.” Taking aim at social mediaFinally, the CSA and the IIROC reminded crypto trading platforms that compliance and supervision requirements also include materials posted on social media websites. As such, these firms must keep their social media content up-to-date by designing “systems that allow for compliant record retention.”“The use of social media sites increases the risk that registered crypto platforms may not be retaining adequate records of their business activities and client communications,” the regulators explained. “Registered [crypto platforms] must design systems that allow for compliant record retention as well as retrieval capability.”Ultimately, while social media platforms may be “challenging in terms of supervision,” crypto platforms should strive to adopt “use a risk-based approach to determine whether a crypto platform’s review of electronic communications is sufficient to meet its supervisory obligations.”“These supervisory obligations are not just restricted to social media use by the [crypto platform] but also by its directors, officers, employees, shareholders, and other third-parties acting on behalf of the [crypto platform],” the letter concluded.Over the past few months, Canadian regulators have been increasing their efforts aimed at crypto-related firms. In May, for example, the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) cracked down on exchanges and charged Poloniex with breaking the country’s securities regulations.In June, the OSC took similar actions against KuCoin."
2021-09-27T12:26:10,Bitcoin Miners Go Nuclear in Search of Clean Energy,https://wp.decrypt.co/81974/bitcoin-miners-go-nuclear-search-clean-energy/,"Amid ongoing criticism around ’s hefty carbon footprint, mining firms are now turning to a new source of energy: nuclear. In July, Bitcoin mining firm Compass Mining already embraced nuclear energy after partnering with Oklo, a nuclear energy startup. Oklo is building out so-called “microreactors” in order to sidestep the enormous logistical hurdles of a full-scale nuclear reactor. Talen Energy, an American energy firm, also announced a similar partnership with TeraWulf Inc., a U.S.-based Bitcoin miner. Talen is building a mining facility the size of four American football fields in Pennsylvania to support the venture. Called the “Nautilus Cryptomine,” the mining site “will create zero-carbon coins with the appropriate regulatory overlay, mined in the United States in a secure location,” said Talen’s president, Alex Hernandez.The primary intrigue of this variety of partnership comes down to Bitcoin’s reputation as a net polluter and the nuclear industry’s ability to generate clean energy. Thus, instead of using harmful fossil fuels to generate the electricity needed to mine Bitcoin, nuclear fission could provide the same results without the carbon emissions. “We are building demand adjacent to the existing nuclear plant,” reportedly said Alex Hernandez, president of Talen Energy, suggesting that mining Bitcoin provides the energy provider with a new revenue stream besides serving energy grids. It’s well understood by many that the flagship cryptocurrency is in urgent need of clean, reliable energy that doesn’t carry hefty carbon emissions. Bitcoin’s energy problemBitcoin’s impact on the environment is now well documented. Per Cambridge University, the Bitcoin network consumes just under 100 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year. This places the Bitcoin network in the company of some of the world’s most energy-guzzling countries. Last year, the network was consuming up to 141 TWh, meaning it would be one of the top 30 countries in the world by energy consumption. Exactly how much of this energy consumption translates into a carbon footprint depends on how much of the energy was sourced from non-renewable—or carbon-intensive—energy sources. According to Cambridge University, only 39% of the Bitcoin network runs on renewable energy. Since the university’s September 2020 study, Bitcoin miners have tried their hand at studies of their own—although their findings have been greeted with skepticism. Due to the fact that Bitcoin mining machines are typically single-purpose machines with short shelf lives, mining also generates a lot of e-waste. According to a recent study by Alex de Vries, founder of the Digiconomist website which tracks the unintended consequences of digital trends, Bitcoin produces as much e-waste as the Netherlands on an annual basis. With that track record, it’s not surprising Bitcoin miners are looking to nuclear energy for a solution. "

These services include fiat deposit services, spot trading of cryptocurrencies, and the purchase of cryptocurrencies through fiat channels and liquid swaps. “We will be restricting Singapore users in respect of the Regulated Payments Services in-line with our commitment to compliance,” Binance said in the statement. The Binance Team also advised Singapore users to cease all related trades, withdraw fiat assets and redeem tokens on October 26 by 04:00am UTC to “avoid potential trading disputes.” The announcement comes amidst regulatory controversy for the exchange in Singapore. Binance’s Singapore strugglesthe crypto exchange has suffered a string of regulatory controversies in recent months, including in Singapore. In August, Singapore’s financial services regulator—the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)—said Binance’s Singapore-registered entity, Binance Asia Services, was not yet licensed in the jurisdiction. The firm was temporarily exempt from needing a license under the Payment Services Act due to a transitional period when the regulator retroactively reviewed the company’s application for a license. At the time, the MAS did not strike an optimistic tone. “We are aware of the actions taken by other regulatory authorities against the crypto exchange and will follow up as appropriate with the applicant,” a MAS spokesperson told Decrypt at the time. One month later, the MAS placed Binance on an Investor Alert List, signaling yet again that the crypto exchange does not have a license to operate in the country. Elsewhere, the crypto exchange has raised the ire of regulators in the UK, the Cayman Islands, Italy, Holland, South Africa, Malaysia, Japan, and others. However, Singapore hits close to home, as it is where the firm’s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, lives.Decrypt has asked Binance to detail what services will remain available for Singapore users, but we have not received a response by print time.

If they like what they see, they might not come back. But stagnancy in this fast-paced market is an even greater risk, especially when splashy headlines about DeFi and NFTs show Robinhood Crypto customers what they might be missing. So on Wednesday, Robinhood announced it will launch a waitlist next month to start allowing withdrawals of coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin, and that all users will be able to move coins onto or off the app by early 2022. “We are enabling our users to take the crypto that they own, move it off the app if they want to, opening up a broader crypto ecosystem,” said Robinhood Crypto COO Christine Brown. “It also enables users who want to consolidate on a single platform to come to Robinhood, get commission-free trading, and all the benefits that we have on our app.”Brown has dangled hints of future “benefits” ever since she spoke to Decrypt in May. This week, in interviews with Decrypt at the Messari Mainnet conference in New York, she again hinted that she’d also like to let customers explore DeFi—while trying to keep them engaged in commission-free trading on Robinhood. “We would love to give more opportunities for our customers,” Brown said onstage at Mainnet, “that would actually make [crypto] a utility in their lives and not just an investment asset.” She had already told Decrypt in May that staking, lending, and other decentralized finance tools are under consideration. That would bring Robinhood Crypto more in line with crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance. Onstage with Brown at Mainnet, Robinhood Crypto CTO Johann Kerbrat echoed the same hints: ""We can't tell too much about our roadmap, but something I'm really excited about is staking in general,"" he said. ""When we are talking about the inflation rising, and savings accounts that are not producing any yield, I think staking could be something very interesting for a lot of people.""Brown also hinted that the platform could add NFT trading if consumer demand warranted it. “If you want to acquire coins at no commission fees … and go acquire an NFT, we’re gonna support that,” she said.Brown said that even once the app adds the option to transfer coins, she expects people will still trade on Robinhood. After all, Robinhood was many people’s first venue for trying crypto, and it’s still far cheaper than trading on Ethereum decentralized exchanges. “A lot of [customers] haven't transacted on-chain,” she said. “So the idea of managing their own keys is something that maybe they don't actually want to do. And so this gives them the best of both worlds… And if they do say, ‘not your keys, not your coins,’ then we support them transferring off for sure.”For Brown, the risk of letting customers leave the platform is worth it. “Wallets is the first step,” she said. “It's taking something that was one dimensional—you buy it, you hold, you sell—hopefully, the price goes up in that time—to something that is multidimensional. You can actually use your coins to do things in the crypto ecosystem."""
2021-09-26T16:42:32,Netflix to Premiere Documentary on $250M QuadrigaCX Scandal Next Year,https://wp.decrypt.co/81936/netflix-to-premiere-documentary-on-250m-quadrigacx-scandal-next-year/,"Next year, Netflix will premiere a new documentary on the QuadrigaCX scandal. Called “Trust No One: The Hunt For The Crypto King”, it will tell the story of Gerard Cotten, the founder of the Canadian crypto exchange who died while on honeymoon in India in 2018, and was thought to have taken $250 million in customer funds to the grave. A press release from Netflix says that the documentary will “follow a group of investors turned sleuths as they try to unlock the suspicious death of cryptocurrency multimillionaire Gerry Cotten and the missing $250 million they believe he stole from them.” Some people thought that Cotten hadn’t actually died but had instead faked his death and fled with customer funds. In December 2019, lawyers representing out-of-pocket customers requested that Canadian police dig up his grave to check he was actually there. The Canadian police denied his request, and people these days generally accept that Cotten really did die of Crohn's disease—but he hadn’t taken the keys to customer funds with him to the grave. According to postmortem findings from Ernst & Young, Cotten had been siphoning funds from QuadrigaCX well before his death and spending them on luxury items, such as cars, planes and yachts. To do this, Cotten created a fake account on QuadrigaCX, then bought his customer’s cryptocurrencies using fake Canadian dollars. Things came to a head when the Ethereum market, to which Cotten was deeply exposed, crashed in 2018 and wiped out his wealth. Investigative work by Amy Castor detailed how Cotten had been scamming for years. Years before crypto was a thing, Cotten was knee-deep in Ponzi schemes, including one that was later shut down by the FBI. The Crypto King, in crypto canon, would make Cotten the male equivalent of the Crypto Queen, named by BBC journalist Jamie Bartlett in his popular radio documentary on alleged Ponzi scheme OneCoin. While QuadrigaCX cost investors hundreds of millions of dollars, Bartlett’s sources claimed that OneCoin had taken as much as $15.8 billion as of early 2018. The new Netflix documentary is directed by BAFTA-nominated documentarian Luke Sewell. It is produced by UK-based Minnow Films, the producer of “My Granny the Escort”, “Dogging Tales” and “When Harry Lost Hogwarts.” Netflix also announced “Tiger King 2”, which will premiere this year, and “The Tinder Swindler,” which tells the story of a conman who posed as a billionaire playboy on Tinder.

The  to make its way to the  of the Dubai music production company is Side-Eyeing Chloe, which 3F bought on Friday for 25 ETH, or $75,315.Side-Eyeing Chloe refers to a 2013 clip of two-year-old Chloe Chlem responding to news of a surprise trip to Disneyland. Chloe’s mother, Katie, films the reaction of her two children.While Chloe’s sister, Lily, is ecstatic about the news of her three-day trip—”YAYYYYYY”—and bursts into tears when she learns of her good fortune, Chloe looks less than impressed. The clip has about 20 million views and the screengrab of Chloe has been reproduced countless times as a meme. Buzzfeed once claimed it was “The Only Reaction You’ll Need For Anything Ever.""The family sold the screengrab, a 660x371 image, as an NFT on September 24. Each pixel thus costs 30 cents. Katie, Chloe’s mother, told the BBC, ""The money is awesome but it's just the fact that we get to do this as a family is so much fun."" Katie said that the family plan to save the ETH instead of converting it all to cash. “In an ever-changing world, it may be worth more next week,” she told the BBC.3F has bought several meme NFTs. The company bought an NFT linked to the Disaster Girl meme for $390,000, an NFT of Kevin Roose’s New York Times column for $560,000, and the Overly Attached Girlfriend meme for $411,000. The company’s founder, Farzin Fardin Fard, holds 393 NFTs in its collection.A clip of Lily learning about another trip to Disneyland, filmed two years earlier, has 19.9 million views. Lily, overwhelmed, sobs to the camera. Chloe, just a baby at the time, once again looks nonplussed by the news. A clip of Lily falling off a swing three years later has 8.6 million views. While grilled by her mother in a 2013 interview, Chloe reveals that her favorite drink is “flavored water,” her favorite animal is “monkeys” and that she is potty-trained. While Chloe became famous for keeping her true feelings close to her chest, she gave one thing away about her trip to Disneyland: she’s wearing a Mickey Mouse t-shirt."

We’re riding a giant flying turtle. Sting rays soar up above.Hoskinson says that Input Output, the software company that creates Cardano, is like Apple, the subtext being that we’re watching the next Steve Jobs. But the difference is that Hoskinson will soon cease to play a leading part in his thriving ecosystem, and we, the bobbles, who by now are throbbing with excitement, we will be the next Steve Jobs. “You made me believe in people again,” says Hoskinson. “You made me believe that there are no problems we cannot solve and no mountains we cannot scale.” But Hoskinson, you gave us something much greater: you made us believe in ourselves! A decentralized application store for Cardano apps is coming, he says, and it is implied that the bobbles, even the errant yellow one who is spinning on her heels, will help fill it. Unlike Apple's App Store, we won't have to ask anyone’s permission to upload our apps. A light mobile wallet is also on the way and Chainlink will integrate with Cardano.In the keynote speech, Hoskinson announces that Dish and Input Output have entered into a strategic partnership. Dish is an American Fortune 200 company that runs the infrastructure for satellite TV—it's the “rebel of the telco space,” says Hoskinson. IOHK will make products with them. It is unclear what products IOHK will produce, but “proof of bandwidth” and decentralized identity and loyalty programs are discussed. “Blockchains are useless without connectivity,” says Chris Ergen, co-founder and chairman of DISH Office of Innovation. Together, the technologies will be “exponentially bigger.” I get distracted from the keynote when a nearby bobble jumps on top of me. The bobble, from Nottinghamshire, England, is incessant and I can't concentrate.

Chastain’s behavior rankled the NFT community, and opened a vacancy for an NFT marketplace that would be decentralized, open-source and undercut OpenSea’s 2.5% commission. Yearn.Finance creator Andre Cronje has heralded that call. His new NFT marketplace, Artion, just launched in beta on the Fantom . And it looks and functions just like OpenSea. Artion, however, takes no commission. It will eventually support the same ERC-721 tokens as OpenSea, and on Fantom, it costs just 1 FTM (about $1.3) to mint an NFT. It can cost several hundred dollars to mint NFTs on . Artion’s NFTs are stored on decentralized web hosting network IPFS, can be no larger than 15mb, and are priced according to feeds from decentralized oracle network . And since Artion’s based on the Fantom blockchain right now, it’s faster and cheaper than the Ethereum-based OpenSea. It’s all open-source, too, and Cronje expects other people to  Artion. Artion’s major limitation right now is choice. There are about 50,000 NFTs on Artion, and they’re all Fantom NFTs. Top of the list is Rarity, Cronje's take on Loot. Artion's collection includes rising projects such as StrangeBrew,FantomPunks, Ancestral Umans, and Fantom WaifusMost of the popular NFT projects are on Ethereum—and OpenSea, which accounts for the vast majority of secondary NFT sales. But Artion’s limited selection could soon change. Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon and Arbitrum are first on Cronje’s list of blockchains to integrate into his marketplace, and he plans to add a new blockchain every week.Sucking up a rival’s platform by forking it, or offering a service with similar fees or additional incentives, is known as “vampire mining.” Sushi did it to decentralized exchange  last summer, and it worked—it’s now a multi-billion dollar protocol. Cronje told  that vampire mining is “not my play” but that, since Artion is open source, other teams could take on OpenSea themselves using Artion's code.If smart developers are inspired by Cronje's marketplace, OpenSea could have a real fight on its hands.

Bitcoin fell from $44,800 to around $41,000, and  fell from about $3,100 to $2,700. Other coins fell, too, and crypto’s global market cap fell from $2 trillion to $1.835 trillion. Now the dust has settled, things are starting to recover—although the gradient is shallow so far. Today, the global market cap for cryptocurrencies increased to $1.916 trillion, Bitcoin hit highs of $43,112 and Ethereum almost punched past $3,000. Some coins were barely affected by China’s ban. Terra (LUNA) fell from $38 to $33 after the news but is now up 11% in the past 24 hours to highs of $41. The coin’s not far off its all-time high of $44, set just 10 days ago. Although the notices came out yesterday, the crypto ban was dated September 15 and the mining document was dated September 3. Since the PBOC issued the notices,  has reportedly prevented Chinese mainland customers from signing up for its exchange services. Huobi Token fell 18% after the news, according to Chinese blockchain journalist Colin Wu, but quickly recovered much of its losses and is down 6% in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. Huobi restricted Chinese mainlanders’ access to derivatives and mining pools months ago following previous statements from the Chinese government. The largest Ethereum mining pool, Spark Pool, and TokenPocket, a DeFi wallet popular in China, have also cut off mainland China residents. Crypto exchange FTX has relocated from Hong Kong to the Bahamas. Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of , cited the lack of quarantine and the crypto-friendly framework as reasons. Hong Kong is a “Special Administrative Region” of China—although the lines have blurred in recent years as China snuffs out Hong Kong’s autonomy. The last time China said that crypto was a scourge on its economy was , when it effectively banned crypto mining to “prevent and control financial risks.” That wrecked the crypto economy, halving Bitcoin’s price in a little under a month. It might seem surprising that the market has not fallen further. However, a lot of crypto trading was already illegal in China, and some people think the notices only clarify existing regulations.Crypto exchanges vacated the country in 2017 and set up shop in Hong Kong, Singapore, elsewhere or, in the case of Binance (up until recently), nowhere at all, claiming that it was decentralized. Miners left China in May and June of this year. Additionally, markets that could have been demolished by the news, namely RMB OTC desks that service mainland Chinese users, are often opaque.Chinese crypto-journalist Wu Blockchain said in a newsletter that the notices introduced a few new things. First, the Supreme Court and the Administration of Foreign Exchange joined in on the notice, “indicating that the crackdown and enforcement might be more intense.”The notice on virtual currencies also specifically mentioned that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether are “not legal and should not and cannot be used as currency.” The focus on Tether suggests that regulators are beginning to investigate stablecoin usage more closely, he said. In China, Tether rivals the central bank’s own digital yuan."
2021-09-25T00:02:26,"WallStreetBets, Source of GameStop Short Squeeze, Launches Crypto Subreddit",https://wp.decrypt.co/81877/wallstreetbets-source-gamestop-short-squeeze-launches-crypto-subreddit/,"WallStreetBets, the Reddit forum whose members coordinated to send GameStop stock through the roof, is creating a separate subreddit just for cryptocurrency discussions.According to a Wednesday announcement from user bawse1, ""It's the same community, same format, same things you love about wallstreetbets, run by the same people.""The WSB forum was ground zero for GameStop stock purchases earlier this year. Its members, who now number close to 11 million, applied memes and the threat of FOMO to encourage their peers to buy up as much GME as they could. The price of the stock, which hung below $20 to start the year, went all the way to $400 within a month as the amateur day traders barrelled through hedge funds' short positions and held their nerve.At first glance, cryptocurrency trading would seem a perfect topic of discussion at WSB. Crypto assets garner the same cultish exuberance as GameStop and other meme stocks do. Sometimes the tokens are fly-by-night pump-and-dump schemes facilitated over Telegram. Other times they're harmless (yet useless) meme coins and tokens looking to replicate Dogecoin's and Shiba Inu's multi-billion dollar market caps.But the WallStreetBets moderators have been standoffish to cryptocurrency. Rule #4 of the forum is ""No Pump & Dump, Crypto Discussions, Schemes or Scams."" The moderators lump in the $2 trillion asset class with SPACs, OTC stocks, and ""other worthless securities that are susceptible to scams.""In April, WSB made a small concession to its members interested in cryptocurrency,  of , , and —but no others—on a single thread. bawse1 wrote that the moderators didn't want to ""burden everyone with crypto spam"" and that the no-crypto rules would apply to the rest of the subreddit.That concession was reversed within 48 hours after  ran an article titled ""WallStreetBets Bows to Crypto."" That ruffled the forum moderators' egos.""Crypto discussion is banned indefinitely,"" declared bawse1. ""I've read a lot of dumb articles written about wsb. This one takes the cake."" He went on to explain that other moderators had been fiercely opposed to adding crypto discussions in the first place but that he remained for it.Now, crypto comments have their own home, with far fewer restrictions. The new subreddit, called WallStreetBetsCrypto, already has 14,000 members. Though it's officially listed as having been formed on January 25, 2018, discussions date only back to Wednesday. Top conversations include the China ban, Solana staking, and shorting Western Union.There are still rules: ""no cheerleading"" for assets or fundraising for them, as well as ""no political bullshit."" ""If it's not about taking advantage of the political to make money then leave that baggage at home,"" rule #5 reads. Not that everyone in WallStreetBets has made money from trading. GameStop is back down below $200, 50% off its yearly high—great for those who bought at $20, but not so good for members who piled on at the peak. Still, the sense of camaraderie and the joy of sticking a finger in traditional finance's eye is enough for some. As one WSB forum member wrote: ""Wallstreetbets never fails to find new and inventive ways to lose money. I'm in."""
2021-09-24T21:11:50,'The Big Short' Investor and Bitcoin Critic Michael Burry Subpoenaed Over GameStop Trading,https://wp.decrypt.co/81862/big-short-investor-bitcoin-critic-michael-burry-subpoenaed-gamestop-trading/,"One of the biggest players in the GameStop saga is being drawn into an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Michael Burry, head of investment firm Scion Asset Management, tweeted today that the firm has received a subpoena from the SEC. A scanned copy of the letter shows that it relates to GameStop Corp. and was issued on September 21. The tweet has since been deleted.Burry owned more than 5% of GameStop stock last year before selling 1.7 million shares in the fourth quarter for between $10 and $20. By January GME shares were trading for over $400; they currently sell for $185 on the New York Stock Exchange. GME's rise was facilitated by an army of amateur day traders and a handful of anonymous Wall Street veterans, who poured into online forums like WallStreetBets to coordinate stock picks. It was the first meme stock, an asset without intrinsic value which is traded for its cultural cachet. Other companies in decline, among them theater company AMC and 2000s throwback BlackBerry, have also found fresh money this year as meme stocks.Meme stocks are close relatives to meme tokens and coins, cryptocurrencies that lack much in the way of utility but can be traded for half-ironic LOLs—and sometimes for big money, if holders can convince others to join in. , launched as a joke nearly a decade ago, is the preeminent meme coin with a market cap of $27 billion. The more recent Shiba Inu, which borrows DOGE's dog-based iconography, has a market cap of $3.6 billion. It recently began trading on , which has found itself in competition with mobile trading app Robinhood—where many if not most GameStop and Dogecoin speculators plied their trade early in 2021.Robinhood's participation in GameStop's rise was contentious. At one point, as GME's price tag was rising, Robinhood restricted users from buying more GME. Users were upset they couldn't buy more, while politicians from progressive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to arch-conservative Ted Cruz suggested a hearing was necessary to determine whether the app was picking winners and losers. Others in government worried that GameStop's surge was a sign of market manipulation, as everyday investors were perhaps being duped by more powerful forces behind the scene—just like crypto pump-and-dump schemes on Telegram.The SEC, led by Gary Gensler, has been listening. And it wants to know what Michael Burry saw, as well as the opinion of others Burry didn't name.He wasn't amused by what was happening in GameStop, tweeting in January: “If I put $GME on your radar, and you did well, I’m genuinely happy for you. However, what is going on now – there should be legal and regulatory repercussions. This is unnatural, insane, and dangerous. @SEC_Enforcement.”Michael Burry was profiled in the book and subsequent movie ""The Big Short"" for his role in shorting—or betting against—subprime mortgages, which ultimately triggered the 2008 financial crisis that brought down more than a few of his colleagues. In June, he said the ""mother of all crashes"" was coming to crypto markets. That's why Burry's latest short is against , or rather, against one of the most Bitcoin-friendly investments. Last month, he built up over 235,000 shares (then worth $31 million) in Cathie Woods' ARK Invest Disruption Innovation exchange-traded fund. ARKK is comprised of shares in Tesla (10%), Coinbase (5%), Square (4%), as well as other companies with investments in Bitcoin. Scion holds a put contract on the shares, giving it the right to sell at a set price; if the ARKK fund drops enough, Scion makes money. Hedging has been a healthy business for Burry, whose fund holds a portfolio worth over $2 billion. For his part, Burry appears to have moved on from his calls for SEC enforcement to step in, tweeting: ""With all that's going on in the world….""After all, ask any crypto founder and they'll tell you: It's hard to make money when you're talking to the SEC."

Its biggest competitor has no such issues., the second-most-popular crypto trading platform, has officially moved its headquarters from Hong Kong to the Bahamas, according to its website. It remains incorporated in Antigua and Barbuda.Earlier this week, FTX Trading Limited received licenses for subsidiaries in Gibraltar and the Bahamas. It will operate under the banner of FTX Digital Markets in the latter, where it is registered as a digital assets business by the Securities Commission of the Bahamas.In a statement on Twitter, FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said, “The Bahamas is one of the few places to set up a comprehensive framework for crypto."" He added that the country ""has emerged from COVID lively, safe, and without quarantine."" The Bahamas, along with other Caribbean countries such as Bermuda, have embraced cryptocurrency businesses. The Bahamas began releasing the Sand Dollar, a central bank digital currency, onto the market last year. And Bahamas-based Deltec bank already provides services to FTX, Tether and other exchanges.Moreover, the country passed the Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges Bill in late 2020, extending licensing to crypto and other Fintech firms. FTX Digital Markets is the first digital asset bill registered under the act. Securities Commission Executive Director Christina Rolle lauded the DARE Act's role in attracting FTX to the island—and hinted that more crypto firms could soon land.
""It’s a huge vote of confidence for the jurisdiction, and what it signals is that you have a big player like this that is really looking for a jurisdiction that has clearly defined the scope of its regulation, and that is what DARE provides,” she told Bahamas' newspaper The Tribune. Imagine Gary Gensler saying that.""Having a comprehensive, nimble regulatory framework with oversight is essential to ensuring that the crypto industry is safe, robust, and growing,"" Bankman-Fried tweeted on Monday. ""We're excited to be one of the first global crypto exchanges to be part of a comprehensive spot + derivatives regulatory regime.""Semi-autonomous Hong Kong, by contrast, is increasingly falling in step with mainland China. The Chinese government reiterated today that cryptocurrency trading remains against the law, though it continues to work on a digital yuan.  Last month, Binance was forced to stop allowing Hong Kong users to trade derivatives—which include futures, options, and perpetual contracts—on its platform. It cited a ""commitment to compliance."" FTX also does the bulk of its exchange volume from crypto derivatives, rather than mere spot trading, making Hong Kong a less-than-desirable location for a base of operations. a major business hub, requires travelers to quarantine in a hotel for as many as three weeks. That cuts into FTX's ability to move quickly as it expands its reach and forges new partnerships."

Gary Gensler, chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, has become more and more vocal lately about the prospect of increased scrutiny of crypto assets—some of which the agency could ultimately deem to be unregistered securities.DAOs are powered and governed by crypto . Could they fall into regulators’ sights? Cooper Turley, a DAO builder who co-founded the Friends With Benefits social DAO and has worked on such initiatives for Audius, Aave, and others—including as an advisor for Decrypt’s own media DAO—welcomes the potential guidance.“A lot of us in DAOs are just moving forward at such a rapid pace that I invite those conversations to happen,” Turley told Decrypt this week at the Messari Mainnet conference.Turley said that he’s unwilling to wait for regulators to chime in—that waiting will only slow down DAO communities that are trying to innovate in the space. Regulation is inevitable, he suggested, and possibly even a good thing—but they’re going to keep building in the meantime.“We can’t operate in the Wild West forever,” he said. “If we want this to scale to billions of users, we need to have clear guidance here. I’m very happy to be out there launching all of these experiments, but I recognize that at some point in time, things are going to get very serious. I think that’s a good signal that this is not going away anytime soon.”The FWB co-founder has had plenty of opportunity to experiment, given his contributions to numerous DAO initiatives. He recently announced that he’s now working full-time on DAOs, in fact, with a focus on building ownership stakes—i.e. tokens. Turley shared with Decrypt why he believes there’s such a swell of interest and excitement around DAO creation right now.“It’s the spirit of community ownership and transparency,” he said. “It’s allowing people to get involved in your product in a more meaningful way. I think we’re very early, maturity-wise, in this reaching scale—but people are very excited about the premise. That’s why we’re seeing so many people allocating so much energy towards it.”The concept of a DAO isn’t new, but it's still early in the wider-scale adoption and implementation of them. Likewise, tools are still being enhanced and refined to help such communities govern themselves, ensure that users are compensated for contributions, and facilitate meaningful dialogue while minimizing noise.According to Turley, there's maturity on the horizon as DAOs implement evolving tools and figure out how to develop legal structures to back the concepts. “They’re going from a novelty phase of making a DAO and a token to actually operating as a company—but in a very web3-native way,” he said."
2021-09-24T14:33:01,Bitcoin's High E-Waste Rate Worsens Environmental Concerns: Digiconomist,https://wp.decrypt.co/81716/bitcoins-high-e-waste-rate-worsens-environmental-concerns/,"From Xinjiang to New York, controversy around Bitcoin's environmental impact has come to the doorsteps of those who mine Bitcoin. It is a commonly cited point in crypto circles that Bitcoin consumes large volumes of electricity—oftentimes over the past year a higher total than some . Now, new research shines a light on a lesser known consequence of Bitcoin mining: e-waste generated by Bitcoin mining machines. The machines are large, expensive, use up a lot of electricity, and have a short shelf-life. When they get discarded, it creates e-waste.According to Alex de Vries, founder of Digiconomist, Bitcoin’s annual e-waste generation is comparable to the equipment waste produced by the Netherlands. De Vries’ research also claims that—on average—every Bitcoin transaction generates 272 grams of e-waste. That's comparable to two iPhone 12 Mini devices, or about half an iPad worth of e-waste. ""I think many people will be able to relate to that,” de Vries told  in a recent interview.The new research suggests that Bitcoin’s already well-documented impact on the environment expands beyond its carbon footprint resulting from reliance on non-renewable resources.“I can imagine that it’s hard for media to cover everything at the same time, but it is something that we need to address,” de Vries added.Bitcoin’s growing e-waste problemPer de Vries, one of the chief drivers of Bitcoin’s e-waste levels is reliance on ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) . The life of these mining rigs is not long. According to Bitcoin mining firm Compass Mining, an ASIC rig—if well maintained—lasts between three to five years. De Vries’ research points to an even bleaker outlook, with these machines lasting 1.3 years on average before becoming “economically obsolete.” “At that point, there’s nothing else you can do with them because they’re single-purpose machines,” de Vries told Decrypt. He added that this results in the mining industry having a “very big incentive” to produce new, more powerful equipment at the expense of older machines. “That’s what leads to this pile of electronic waste at the end,” he said. On the other hand, de Vries suggests in his study that it is “theoretically possible” for old devices to regain profitability should Bitcoin’s price increase and drive up mining income. What can be done?Bitcoin’s carbon footprint has come under intense scrutiny in recent months, with NGOs like Earth Justice lobbying regulators to review the impact of Bitcoin mining in their communities. But de Vries argues that the solution to Bitcoin’s e-waste—as well as its wider carbon footprint—should come from the Bitcoin community itself. “Ideally, the change would come from within, and I personally believe that the only optimal solution is to just take out the proof of work mining entirely, and try to replace it with a more sustainable alternative,” de Vries said, adding that moving Bitcoin to a  consensus—instead of the energy intensive proof-of-work consensus it relies on—would help. “If you make such a change, then the environmental impact will no longer be a concern,” he concluded. Of course, there is almost no sign right now that Bitcoiners will voluntarily pivot their cryptocurrency to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism as de Vries suggests, so solutions to curb Bitcoin’s e-waste must come from elsewhere. Policymakers could help, de Vries suggests, in two ways. The first is by simply raising awareness on the issues surrounding e-waste. “Investor concerns over the energy-hunger of the Bitcoin network, for instance, have shown how transparency on environmental impacts may lower demand,” de Vries wrote. Second, policymakers can “enforce and improve recycling practices,” which in turn can limit the sheer volumes of e-waste collected in societies—if they're compelled to act."

Now he’s partnered with a noted fine art gallery to launch an NFT marketplace.Art Official is the name of the marketplace, and it’s an Ethereum-based platform for digital artwork. It was created in partnership between real-world gallerist Vito Schnabel—who has locations in New York and Switzerland—and Vaynerchuk’s VaynerNFT consultancy.The platform’s first offering is a series of works by Italian contemporary artist Francesco Clemente, marking his first digital compositions. The winner of the piece “Milarepa’s Dream,” which depicts a white flag piercing a heart, will also receive a live watercolor portrait session with Clemente, who has previously painted noted artists and public figures.Additionally, the auction will launch with NFT compositions from Clemente’s project “Our Backs to the Sea Far From Our Native Lands,” which features music from influential composer and pianist Philip Glass. A live artist experience is also included with those NFTs.An NFT acts like a deed of ownership to a verifiably scarce digital item, whether it’s a painting, a video file, or something else entirely. In this case, Art Official is also bundling in a live experience component to try and differentiate its offerings and create more demand.“What inspired me to launch an NFT marketplace for artwork was the partnership with Vito, because of the access to the extremely high-quality artists that we were going to be able to put on the platform,” Vaynerchuk told Decrypt. “That was going to be a major differentiation in the space. At the end of the day, Vito's ability to curate, and our ability to innovate on the product offerings and the strategy around the art—and create demand for it—is a winning combo.”Later this fall, Art Official will launch what it is billing as the “first opera NFT”—an original audiovisual work from Grammy-winning composer Mason Bates. Additionally, Vito Schnabel Gallery artists such as Jordan Kerwick, Spencer Lewis, Robert Nava, Ariana Papademetropoulos, Julian Schnabel, and filmmaker Gus Van Sant will launch NFTs on the platform.The NFT space has no shortage of marketplaces for buying and selling artwork. Leading marketplace OpenSea—which had more than $3.4 billion worth of trading volume in August—is best known for secondary sales. Meanwhile platforms like SuperRare and Nifty Gateway focus on curated NFT drops from an array of creators, including celebrities, digital artists, and more.Schnabel told Decrypt that Art Official will set itself apart from the pack by focusing on the fine art world and being the first NFT marketplace from an established commercial art gallery. Furthermore, it’s the first such NFT art marketplace created in partnership with Vaynerchuk, whom Schnabel described as “one of the visionaries of the NFT realm.”“The art world has thus far talked primarily to itself in its forays into the realm of NFTs,” said Schnabel. “Our concept is to broaden the conversation considerably by talking to the NFT universe that already exists and is brimming with activity, to speak the language of that universe and to help our artists do the same. Our goal is to give fine artists a runway into that world.”"

Buy coins, earn yield, borrow, and transfer with no fees,” the firm’s website touts.According to Kentucky’s regulator, however, the company’s interest accounts are actually securities that are allegedly being sold without proper registration.“The Department has become aware that the Company is offering securities in the form of investment contracts in exchange for the deposit of assets with the Company. These investment contracts allow passive investors to earn profit in the form of interest on the assets deposited with the Company, and qualify as securities under the Act,” Kentucky’s regulator argued.According to the order, 1,607 EIAs have been opened for 1,571 Kentucky investors in the past three years and four months. In total, residents of the state have deposited roughly $17.6 million worth of various cryptocurrencies to Celsius while the company has paid them just over $453,000 over the same period.As part of its reasoning, the regulator pointed out that all securities—which Celsius’ EIAs allegedly are—must be properly registered as such.“A review of the Department's records revealed that neither Celsius nor the EIAs offered on its website are registered with the Department as required under the Act. Additionally, neither Celsius nor these EIAs appear to be entitled to any exemption from registration under the Act,” the order stated. Additionally, the department pointed out that Celsius' EIAs are not protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) nor insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).“As a result, Celsius investors are subject to additional risks compared to investors who maintain assets with most SIPC member broker-dealers, banks and savings associations, or credit unions,” the regulator explained.Decrypt has reached out for additional comments to Celsius Network’s CEO Alex Mashinsky but did not receive a reply at press time.With the addition of Kentucky, a total of four U.S. states have already taken similar actions against Celsius.Just last week, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities filed a cease and desist order against the company to stop offering its high-interest accounts in the state. On the same day, the Texas State Securities Board ordered the firm to appear for an administrative hearing in February. On September 16, the Alabama Securities Commission also filed its own cease and desist order against Celsius on the same grounds."

2021-09-23T21:52:25,From Ethereum to Solana and Back: Wormhole Lets You Send Your NFTs Across Blockchains,https://wp.decrypt.co/81764/ethereum-solana-wormhole-send-nfts-across-blockchains/," may currently rule the  collectibles space, but Solana has recently emerged as a rival with puny fees and speedy transactions—neither an  strength. But you can’t buy  NFTs on OpenSea or use the popular  , for that matter, so there’s clear distance between the ecosystems. Until now, that is.Launched yesterday, the Wormhole NFT Bridge connects Ethereum and Solana with a way to transfer assets between the competing blockchains. It’s a bi-directional bridge that can send assets in either direction, effectively “wrapping” the original NFT asset to make it fully compatible with the other platform.For example, if you wanted to bring a Solana NFT over to Ethereum to sell it on OpenSea, the bridge would first lock the original NFT asset within the Wormhole  on Solana. A smart contract is what powers decentralized apps ,  protocols, NFTs, and more, all via code that performs set instructions.Rather than literally transfer the asset from Solana to Ethereum, the NFT is frozen within the smart contract and then a new version is minted on Ethereum. The resulting ERC-721 NFT asset can be used and transferred like any native Ethereum NFT, and you can always bridge it back to Solana to release the original version from the smart contract. ERC-1155 standard support is planned, as well.“Users that are only active on a single chain have no way of getting access to exciting NFTs on others,” Hendrik Hofstadt, co-founder of lead Wormhole contributor Certus One and now Director of Special Projects at Jump Crypto, told Decrypt. “The Wormhole NFT Bridge solves this and allows users to acquire new NFTs that were previously inaccessible, or tap into the liquidity of other chains' marketplaces.”An NFT acts like a deed of ownership to a rare digital item, such as an image, video clip, or interactive video game item. Ethereum is the leading platform for NFTs, including such popular projects as CryptoPunks and Art Blocks, and Ethereum-based marketplace OpenSea generated more than $3.4 billion in transaction volume in August alone, per Dune Analytics.Why would someone bridge an NFT between Ethereum and Solana? For starters, Ethereum has the popular OpenSea marketplace (and others), which could open up Solana-based collections like Degenerate Ape Academy, , and Aurory to a wider audience of potential buyers.Ethereum NFT collectors may want to bring something over from Solana to put into a single wallet or collection, as well. And there may be upside to porting assets from Ethereum to Solana. After all, Solana is much faster and cheaper to use than Ethereum at present, so moving assets around could prove to be more efficient on the so-called “Ethereum killer.”Wormhole was first announced in October 2020 with a focus on DeFi applications, with Solana itself pushing the project as a way to scale Ethereum apps with a secondary chain. Last week, ahead of the NFT bridge launch, Wormhole released the v2 version of its main Token Bridge, with plans to add support for other blockchains Binance Smart Chain and Terra, as well.The launch comes following rapid growth for Solana’s ecosystem, with rising use across DeFi and NFTs, as well as an explosion in value for the SOL cryptocurrency. It skyrocketed in price from about $35 at the start of August to an all-time high above $213 earlier this month, according to data from CoinGecko. However, last week’s Solana network crash may have slowed that momentum: SOL is down 21% over the last 14 days.“Solana offers users cheap and fast transactions which allow dapps to deliver almost web2-level experiences, enabling a new group of users to get into the space,” Hofstadt commented. “I think this is a valuable component in a cross-chain world where different chains serve different use cases, and adoption clearly highlights that.”"
2021-09-23T20:26:38,Ethereum Futures More Popular Among Major Investors Than Bitcoin: JP Morgan,https://wp.decrypt.co/81751/ethereum-futures-more-popular-bitcoin-jp-morgan/,"Investment bank JP Morgan said Wednesday that investors are looking to  futures instead of —meaning there's now more interest in the second biggest cryptocurrency among major investors, according to reports. This pivot in interest is a “setback for Bitcoin,” according to a Thursday Business Insiderreport citing a note from the bank.  futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s (CME) traded below the price of  this month, the report noted. JP Morgan reportedly said this was due to “weak demand by institutional investors.”Bitcoin futures refer to when investors place bets and trade contracts that deal with the future price of the cryptocurrency and not the actual asset itself. It’s a huge market, and there is more interest in it than spot trading (where investors buy and sell Bitcoin the cryptocurrency) in terms of cash invested. For example, 24-hour volume at , the world’s biggest crypto exchange, for spot trading is currently $23 billion. For futures trading, right now it’s $65 billion. Investors can get stuck into futures trading of most major cryptocurrencies, but the biggest assets by market cap—Bitcoin and —are the most popular contracts to trade. This is seen as a good way for old-school investors to get involved in the crypto market without having to deal with buying and storing actual cryptocurrency, which can still be confusing and burdensome for more traditional investors.JP Morgan reportedly said in its investor note that the interest in Ethereum futures points to much a “healthier demand for Ethereum vs. Bitcoin by institutional investors,” referring to big organizations—like hedge funds—with huge piles of cash to play with. When there is high demand for Bitcoin, futures tend to trade at a higher price than the crypto. But this hasn’t been the case in September, according to CME data. Investors have instead been eyeing up Ethereum since August and the 21-day average Ethereum futures premium rose 1% more than the price of the asset, JP Morgan reportedly said. But despite this interest in futures, both cryptocurrencies are struggling: Bitcoin is down 7% in the past week, trading at $44,840, while Ethereum is down 12%—today valued at $3,152, as per CoinGecko data."
2021-09-23T19:42:14,New Desktop App Makes It Easier to Mine Ethereum,https://wp.decrypt.co/81754/new-desktop-app-makes-it-easier-mine-ethereum/,"At any one time, there are millions of machines mining , contributing to network security and validating transactions in exchange for the chance to earn some ETH. But to make mining profitable, most people need expensive hardware with lots of computing power. Network, an Ethereum-based platform for sharing unused computing power, has a small solution for those who want to contribute to the network without going all in.Today, it announced Thorg, a free Ethereum mining app for PCs. Though it's been built for gamers and other folks such as miners who already have powerful home computers, Golem is promising the app ""will support more machine types in the near future.""While there are other ways to passively mine ETH on a home computer, leveraging the Golem Network can help people quickly scale up their resources without filling their room with hardware. ""Since it’s not a regular miner or mining scheme, but a different proposal towards idle machines and their computing power, there are no direct competitors so far,"" Golem Network CEO Piotr Janiuk told via message.Golem is analogous to , the decentralized network that allows people to sell and buy computer storage via the FIL token. Only, instead of storage, Golem facilitates the buying and selling of computing power that would otherwise go unused. If you're a gamer by night and have extra power to share by day, you can get compensated in the Golem token, GLM, for renting it out.Thorg uses —a layer-2 scaling solution—to facilitate payments, thereby avoiding the high fees associated with Ethereum. However, that results in an indirect way of mining ETH as Thorg users receive a different asset—GLM—for their troubles. And, as the product page notes, if you want to move that GLM off of Polygon and onto Ethereum, you'll have to pay fees in Polygon's native MATIC token to cover the cost.Still, that should be fine with those who aren't hell-bent on receiving ETH and just want a low-intensity way of making some crypto income. Said Janiuk in a press release, ""Thorg enhances the Golem platform as this mining use-case opens up new and exciting ways of creating a healthy and efficient market by providing additional tools for optimizing passive income."" Golem's market cap has more than quadrupled in the past year and stands just shy of $500 million. Its token is priced near $0.50."

And on , the fast-rising  competitor to , you have to use Grape to get through the crypto-gated gates. is a startup that provides tools for  and  projects to build, manage, and incentivize formalized communities known as . The company launched just five months ago, and it’s already beginning to position itself as an essential tool on the Solana network.Today, Grape announced a $1.2 million seed round led by the . That’s on top of the $600,000 that it raised in a  sale last week—the one that generated so much hype and demand from investors, it .Was the GRAPE worth the squeeze?It was a day filled with “mixed emotions,” said Grape’s Co-Founder Dean Pappas of the  on September 14. Solana, which is often billed as a next-gen “Ethereum killer”—a faster, cheaper, more user-friendly version of the blockchain network that gave birth to programmable money—ultimately buckled under the pressure of Grape’s IDO—a type of token sale similar to an .Grape’s token sale on the decentralized exchange  was ravaged by bots unleashed by tech-savvy crypto traders eager to fill their wallets with GRAPE tokens. The bots slammed Solana with so many transaction requests at once that the network couldn’t cope—it was knocked offline by what the Solana Foundation says was, “in effect, a denial of service attack.” As a result,  came to a screeching halt—all over what amounted to $600,000 worth of tokens from, what for many observers at the time was, a largely unknown crypto startup.“We kinda reveled in the fact that, ‘Hey, look what we did.’ You know? That was the primary emotion,” Pappas told  in an interview. “We had full confidence in everything coming back to normal,” he said.It’s this “monumental” level of demand that led Grape to raise more money, said Pappas. “Right now, we have so much demand for the product, we can’t keep up [while] also stick to growing our roadmap,” he said. “This [raise] was imperative based on how fast adoption has been. We just can’t keep up. We needed to do funding to expand the team.”Do or DAO for SolanaIt may sound like braggadocio, but Pappas isn’t embellishing. With DAOs still in their infancy—and Solana arguably even more so—there aren’t a lot of companies doing what Grape is doing right now. In fact, in terms of rivals, Pappas points to a combination of , , and —on Ethereum—as Grape’s primary competitors. “Those three are always used for all these tokenized communities, but they don’t co-exist together under the same umbrella,” he said.But on Solana, the field is still wide open, and Grape has—for now—essentially cornered the market as the all-in-one, build-a-DAO provider.A DAO (shorthand for “decentralized autonomous organization”) is essentially a way of coordinating a group of like-minded people who aim to build something together and then share in the fruits of that labor in an equitable way. There are hundreds of DAOs throughout cryptoland, most of them on Ethereum, that serve different purposes—but all of them generally share one thing in common: in order to prove you belong to a DAO, you must hold a certain amount of that community’s cryptocurrency or token of choice.Grape’s flagship product, Grape Access, is how Solana users prove they belong to a specific DAO and gain access to a given community’s private chat room on Discord. All users have to do is link their Discord accounts to a Solana wallet, such as , through Grape’s website, and then load up that wallet with all the right tokens. Those tokens then act as the keys to unlock these otherwise hidden rooms.Grape’s initial clients on Solana were all DeFi products—peer-to-peer lending, borrowing, and trading protocols like  and . But it wasn’t until the NFT boom on Solana that the DAO business really started to pick up, says Pappas.NFTs are special types of tokens that demonstrate proof of ownership over a digital item. So-called profile picture NFTs, such as  and  on Ethereum, have become hugely popular—and very lucrative for early investors. Many of these NFTs, which are typically limited to 10,000 or fewer tokens within a single collection and originally “minted” for just a few hundred dollars, are now individually selling for hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars on secondary markets.All of the major, or “blue chip,” NFT projects on Solana—such as , , , and —use Grape to gate off certain channels within their Discords, or entire servers, from the outside world. Owning one of these NFTs, then, becomes more than just an online flex or investment opportunity—it becomes a ticket to an exclusive club for holders, and potentially even a say in how treasuries are managed and revenues are split among investors.Nobody rides for freeA large number of NFT projects, and users, have migrated over from Ethereum to Solana within the past year, largely driven by the promise of “free gas” on the network.  is the variable cost of transacting on a blockchain network, and on Ethereum, those costs are sky-high: on busy days, it’s not uncommon for users to pay $200 to $300 for a transaction that’s itself worth far less than that.But Solana’s near-zero transaction costs are a double-edged sword, Pappas admits. “Spam is cheap,” he said, which is why bots are able to swarm the network so easily. Bots have also become a problem for NFT drops on the network, as ordinary users struggle to compete with more sophisticated players armed with bots that snap up desirable NFTs on launch days. Some projects, however, are already coming up with workarounds. , for example,  to confuse bots when the project gave away 10,000 NFTs for free last week. Anyone lucky enough to nab one can now join the SnekDAO, verified through Grape on Discord.“I think the benefits massively outweigh [the problems],” said Grape’s co-founder. “Like, with us, for example, we can iterate and discover things so much faster than our potential counterparts on Ethereum because there’s no risk to experiment.”What’s more, NFTs and DAOs are a natural marriage, according to Pappas, and the “easiest utility to point to,” he says. “There’s huge value there. It’s an unexplored space. That’s what exciting. DeFi, to some extent, and it’s weird to say this, but it’s matured. But in this area [NFTs], this is completely green, unexplored space.”Grape sees its product line soon growing beyond just Access. DAO management tools and event planning—token-based ticketing for both virtual and real-life events—are all on the roadmap, says Grape’s co-founder. “What we’re aspiring to do is give a toolset that lets people create their own digital civilizations. Start from scratch. What are the economics going to like? What’s our theory of meritocracy or democracy? There’s all these choices we can make from scratch.”After all, it’s not enough to just get through the gates—the success of any given DAO will depend on what the community builds within its walls. Said Pappas: “What are you going to put behind the gate? Because, otherwise, the gate’s just a novelty.”"
2021-09-23T11:24:49,President Biden Expected to Nominate Crypto Critic to OCC,https://wp.decrypt.co/81631/president-biden-expected-nominate-crypto-critic-occ/,"Saule Omarova has reportedly been nominated as the next in line to run the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), according to Bloomberg. Omarova, a professor at Cornell University Law School, is also keenly aware of the crypto industry and hasn’t shied away from sharing her mostly critical view of the sector. In February of this year, Omarova shared a Financial Times article titled “’s rise reflects America’s decline,” later tweeting that “getting out of the post-COVID recession via real economy growth” is of the “utmost importance.”Back in 2019, she said Bitcoin’s rise from an “obscure techno-utopian experiment” to an asset featured in institutional investor portfolios is a “vivid example of how fintech technology can be, and is used to synthesize tradable financial assets effectively out of thin air.” According to Bloomberg, Omarova has described the rise of cryptocurrencies as “benefiting mainly the dysfunctional financial system we already have,” placing her firmly in line with some of the United States’ most prominent regulatory and political figures to have taken aim at crypto. Omarova also joins a long list of politicians and regulators that believe that the financial world is inherently political. In a written testimony to the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, from 2018 Omarova said “money and power are two sides of the same coin. Finance is, and always will be, a matter of utmost and direct public policy significance.”“‘Virtualizing’ financial transactions does not change this basic fact, only obscures it from view,” she added. The United States’ crypto skepticsThis year has seen several prominent names in the United States’ political and regulatory scene adopt critical stances against cryptocurrencies. One such example is Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who said the crypto industry needs “rules of the road” in order to protect consumers. “I don’t want to wait until a whole lot of people, a whole lot of small investors, a whole lot of small traders have been completely wiped out,” Warren said on a CNBC interview in July. Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, agrees with Senator Warren. In fact, he’s gone further than simply saying the crypto industry needs better consumer protection laws. He’s also said many “crypto tokens” (as he describes them) look like unregistered securities, cryptocurrencies do not fulfill the proper function of money, and cryptocurrencies also facilitate crime. Just this week, Gensler doubled down, saying cryptocurrencies need to be regulated to protect the “stability of the system.”"
2021-09-23T10:10:56,FCA Chief Reminds Crypto Investors They Could ‘Lose All Their Money’,https://wp.decrypt.co/81619/fca-chief-reminds-crypto-investors-could-lose-all-their-money/,"Nikil Rathi, CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) reiterated the regulator’s firm stance on cryptocurrencies during a speech in London yesterday. “As you will all know, we have warned repeatedly investors in [crypto] products must be ready to lose all their money,” he said at the Mansion House in London yesterday. He added that the FCA has “often been criticized for acting slowly or with too much aversion,” but that this is changing and the FCA is now applying a much stricter approach “in dealing with serious misconduct.” Rathi’s comments come after a long line of crypto-related clampdowns issued by the FCA, dating back to as early as January of this year. FCA’s difficult relationship with cryptoTo kick off 2021, the FCA issued a list of five concerns consumers should keep in mind when dealing with cryptocurrencies. These five concerns were a lack of consumer protection, price volatility, product complexity, charges and fees, and misleading marketing material. “Investing in crypto assets, or investments and lending linked to them, generally involves taking very high risks with investors’ money. If consumers invest in these types of products, they should be prepared to lose all their money,” the FCA said at the time. Two months later, the FCA started applying some regulatory pressure on crypto asset businesses. In a March announcement, the regulator said crypto firms would now be required to provide annual financial crime reports—a commonplace requirement in the world of finance, but a controversial issue in the crypto space. This summer, the FCA turned its attention to Binance, one of the crypto industry’s most well-known and most used cryptocurrency exchanges. British Regulator takes on BinanceIn June, the FCA issued a consumer warning to Binance Markets Limited (BML), a Binance entity that was acquired to own and operate a bespoke crypto exchange for UK customers. The regulator told Decrypt its ban was based on the firm’s approach (or lack of approach) to appropriate anti-money laundering standards. “Putting two and two together, we obviously have issues with standards in that area,” a spokesperson for the FCA toldDecrypt. Last month, the FCA doubled down on its Binance stance, claiming the crypto exchange is “not capable” of being regulated after BML reportedly refused to provide basic information about its business. “The FCA considers that the firm’s responses have been incomplete and have included direct refusals to provide information. These include failures to provide details about how the business and Group are organized,” the FCA said in a supervisory notice. Binance has also repeatedly failed to reply to Decrypt’s multiple requests for information about how the business and group are organized. "

NBA Top Shot helped drive NFTs into the mainstream earlier this year, and some teams even have their own NFT projects. But not every high-profile NFT project lands well with collectors, as NBA player John Wall just discovered.The Houston Rockets player has rapidly embraced NFTs, tweeting just a week ago that he was “hopping into the NFT wave” before announcing his own -based NFT profile pictures project on Tuesday. Dubbed Baby Ballers, the project’s first teaser image shows a cartoonish illustrated baby spinning a ball on its finger and standing against a 3D basketball court.But there’s an early hitch or two, and Wall has received criticism as a result. Most glaringly, the initial NFT teaser image was revealed to have repurposed a screenshot from Epic Games’ popular video game Fortnite, as social media sleuths quickly discovered. On top of that, the illustration appears to be strongly inspired by the character design from the “Boss Baby” film series.An NFT acts like a deed of ownership for a rare digital item, including images and video clips, and Baby Ballers is similar in approach to a lot of NFT profile picture projects. This one will drop 4,000 images that can be minted and purchased, plus there’s a charity component with $100,000 set to be donated to unspecified causes. Wall says he will himself personally participate in rewards and benefits for the NFT owners, as well.In a viral tweet, Twitter user SudoShoe tweeted a series of screenshots showing the comparison to Fortnite and Boss Baby assets, writing, “The progression of a celebrity trying to start an NFT cash grab.” Other users chimed in, suggesting that it was “disgusting and disrespectful” to other artists and web3 builders, or asking, “You think you can hide here?”In an announcement in the Baby Ballers Discord server this morning, an administrator wrote that the final, minted NFTs would not use the Fortnite background. The team claimed that it “reached out to Epic Games” and was told that since the NFT project ultimately won’t sell the teased image, that it “falls under their fan art policy.”Instead, the team plans to hire new artists and designers. Additionally, moderators have been squelching criticism and mocking posts in the Discord, warning new users against spreading “FUD”—a common crypto industry term for “fear, uncertainty, and doubt.” In other words, anything deemed to be negative about the project is off limits.“Please understand that we have no plans of making this the typical celebrity ‘cash grab’ that is sometimes seen in the community,” the team wrote in the announcement post. “We have lots planned for our NFT holders including in-person fan experiences, valued merch, and lots of collaborative events and giveaways post launch.”Wall has since deleted his tweet with the teaser image featuring the Fortnite backdrop, and shared a new tweet that has a Baby Ballers illustration on a plain white backing. The launch is currently planned for September 30, and “everything will be addressed” in a Discord community call with Wall tonight, per the moderators."

In 2021, the herd has indeed arrived, but so has the law.The newly minted Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler did not set foot inside the Messari Mainnet conference in New York this week, but he was nonetheless ubiquitous, conducting an interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday—streamed live at the conference—in which he called cryptocurrencies ""an asset class that's ."" the billionaire investor and Bitcoin bull said. ""There's also absolutely no doubt about it that he wants to regulate crypto. Clear as could be. He wants to be the sheriff of Cryptoville."" Gensler also used his interview on Tuesday to make the case to D.C. lawmakers that the SEC is the entity best placed to regulate the nascent $2 trillion crypto industry and the lending protocols that are fueling its growth. “It’s highly likely that [lending platforms] have thousands of tokens, and it’s highly likely that they have on these platforms securities investment contracts or notes or others that fit the definition of a security,” Gensler said, concluding “there’s going to be a problem on lending platforms or trading platforms.” The SEC has flexed its muscle of late, allegedly pushing  to drop its Lend product ; Coinbase had planned to use the project to deliver high-yield returns on specific cryptocurrencies held with the exchange. Celsius and BlockFi, which run their own high-yield crypto interest accounts,  with cease-and-desist letters and other enforcement actions by several state securities regulators, including in the companies' home state of New Jersey.But Novogratz isn't working on crypto lending, at least not yet. His newest focus is to get a U.S. crypto ETF (exchange-traded fund) approved by the SEC, which has yet to approve one. Galaxy Digital this week partnered with giant investment management firm Invesco to file a new  proposal. ETFs are the holy grail of crypto investing because they trade like stocks and integrate easily into retirement portfolios. ""Ubiquity is what's going to allow us to get to the next level,"" Novogratz said on the panel, because more people leads to increased liquidity and lower volatility.Moreover, Novogratz isn't concerned that he's wasting his time. During the panel, he mentioned that he's working to hire someone who can speak D.C.'s language and teach lawmakers about crypto.""The SEC will get there,"" he said. ""I'm sure. I don't know when, but I'm sure they will get there."""
2021-09-22T21:03:53,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Recover as Evergrande Fears Subside, Fed Talks ‘Tapering’",https://wp.decrypt.co/81590/bitcoin-ethereum-recover-evergrande-fed/,"—and the wider cryptocurrency market—today bounced back after a troubling start to the week for investors, aided by a Federal Reserve announcement and good news from Chinese property developer Evergrande. The biggest digital asset by market cap was trading at $43,796, a 3.8% 24-hour increase, according to CoinGecko data. , the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, also made hopeful gains of 5.3% in 24 hours and was trading at $3,089. It had been hit hard Monday—harder than Bitcoin—and was just yesterday trading below $3,000, the first time it dipped that low since August 6. The wider crypto market followed suit and was largely in the green today. , the sixth biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, was trading at $148.49, an increase of 14% since yesterday. It’s still down 25% from its all-time high above $200 earlier this month. And , billionaire Elon Musk’s favorite crypto and the tenth biggest digital asset by market cap, made modest gains of 1.5%; it was trading for $0.22 at the time of writing. The crypto market was struggling Monday and Tuesday—along with the global equities market—partly due to concerns over a potential global financial fallout related to Chinese property developer giant Evergrande. The company has $300 billion-worth of debt that some analysts say it won’t be able to pay back. The situation has had some wondering whether this could amount to China’s “Lehman moment,” suggesting that the country could be on the verge of a financial crisis on par with the one caused by Lehman Brothers' collapse in 2008.Today, though, the Shenzhen-based company said it agreed to settle interest payments on a domestic bond. This calmed previously spooked global markets. But what have global equities and China, the world’s second largest economy, got to do with cryptocurrencies like  and Dogecoin? Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are generally perceived to be speculative and risky assets. And when there is global financial uncertainty, big investors tend to sell riskier assets, like cryptocurrency or certain equities. This is what appeared to happen yesterday and Monday, according to some analysts.  Meanwhile, as fears over Evergrande apparently subsided, the U.S. Federal Reserve also announced today it would keep benchmark interest rates anchored near zero. It also raised inflation expectations and pushed its timetable for the tapering of the central bank’s bond purchases to 2022. When this has previously happened, Bitcoin—and other cryptocurrencies—have gone up in value. This is because interest-bearing investments, such as bonds or debt-based financial instruments, aren’t generating interest and are therefore less attractive to investors. Alternative assets, such as Bitcoin, then become more attractive. Investors losing confidence in the U.S. dollar due to inflation could mean more money flowing into assets such as Bitcoin, which might help explain today’s market movements."

The exchange will be an international marketing partner of the team and can also use 76ers branding in marketing and advertising efforts.Furthermore, Crypto.com branding will be featured at the team’s Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, on both the baseline apron and courtside displays. The deal also includes an advertising presence for Crypto.com across the 76ers’ television broadcasts and social media and marketing channels.Crypto.com will also release the team’s first official NFT collectibles through its marketplace. An NFT acts as a deed of ownership to a provably scarce digital item, and can represent images, video files, and other types of collectibles. Dapper Labs’ NBA Top Shot has been one of the most popular NFT projects to date.Terms and length of the deal were not disclosed, although 76ers Head of Business Operations Chris Heck described it as a “long-term partnership” in today’s announcement.Crypto.com has made a number of deals across the sports landscape in recent months, including partnerships with leagues like Formula 1 and Ultimate Fighting Championship, as well as the NHL’s Montreal Canadiens, soccer club Paris Saint-Germain F.C., and F1’s Aston Martin Cognizant. This is the exchange’s first deal with an NBA team.Rival cryptocurrency exchange FTX has employed a similar approach to sports sponsorships in 2021, inking deals with Major League Baseball, the NBA’s Miami Heat, and esports team TSM, as well as athletes like Tom Brady and Stephen Curry.That spending has coincided with a rise in web traffic to FTX of late. FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried told Decrypt Editor-in-Chief Daniel Roberts last week that while he couldn’t prove that its sports sponsorship efforts are boosting customer acquisition, the anecdotal rise in name recognition has been massive.“You just can’t buy that with Facebook ads,” Bankman-Fried said of FTX’s sports deals.Crypto.com may be looking for the same kind of awareness bump, although it’s unclear whether that’s been the case so far—a look at web traffic data from SimilarWeb doesn’t show the same kind of rise that FTX has enjoyed in recent months.When asked last week about the impact of its sports partnerships to date, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek wouldn’t share specifics, only telling Decrypt, “We have been overwhelmed by how well all of our partnerships have been received by fans around the world.”"

By essentially batching multiple transactions together while they are being processed, roll-ups help to take some load off the mainnet, allowing for lower transaction fees and higher speeds.This feature would be especially beneficial to 1inch users since the platform’s modus operandi is to offer its customers the best possible crypto trading opportunities across dozens of DEXs. 1inch does this by searching for the lowest prices and rerouting its customers’ trades between different exchanges.“The Arbitrum One ecosystem is vibrant with many excellent and high volume DEXes, and we’re very excited to have 1inch join as a DEX aggregator,” added Steven Goldfeder, CEO of Arbitrum developer Offchain Labs.Per the announcement, both the 1inch Aggregation Protocol and the 1inch Limit Order Protocol are now deployed on Arbitrum One.“As it's gonna become the fifth blockchain supported by 1inch, the UX will be pretty much the same as for Optimism, Polygon or [Binance Smart Chain]. And just as for Optimism, Polygon, BSC—users will need to migrate their assets from Ethereum to Arbitrum via a bridge,” Sergey Maslennikov, chief communications officer of 1inch Network, explained to Decrypt.He added that seven blockchain protocols in total will be available via 1inch on Arbitrum at launch (with more to follow in the future): Uniswap, Balancer, 1inch Limit Order Protocol, DODO, SushiSwap, Swapr, and WETH.Meanwhile, 1inch’s mobile wallet app with Arbitrum support is currently undergoing a revision in AppStore and “should go live in a day or so,” Maslennikov noted.Arbitrum continues growth Arbitrum is an Optimistic Rollup solution that supports the same byte code as Ethereum so that Ethereum developers could easily cross-compile their contracts for running on Arbitrum. This ensures full compatibility with Ethereum on the smart contract and Web3 interface levels. Last week, the total value of assets flowing through Arbitrum swiftly darted above $2 billion thanks to a surge of interest in NYAN, a new token based on a popular rainbow cat-centric video.That figure has since dropped to roughly $640 million, according to data aggregator DeFi Llama."
2021-09-22T14:20:35,Dfinity to Launch Bitcoin Smart Contracts on the Internet Computer,https://wp.decrypt.co/81545/dfinity-launch-bitcoin-smart-contracts-internet-computer/,"The Dfinity Foundation, which is behind the Internet Computer blockchain, announced on Tuesday that it will be integrating with , opening up the cryptocurrency to , and decentralized finance  applications on its network by the end of the year.  “Internet Computer smart contracts will gain access to Bitcoin liquidity, and Bitcoin will gain powerful new smart contract functionality, without the need for insecure and cumbersome trusted bridging services,” said Dfinity founder Dominic Williams, in a statement accompanying the announcement.A DeFi ecosystem for Bitcoin is a major industry initiative. It would mean the world’s most popular cryptocurrency could be used for lending, yield farming, derivatives, liquidity pools, and more—just like the current industry leader, Ethereum. The Internet Computer is designed to act as an alternative to the cloud-based infrastructure of today’s worldwide web, and was launched in May, having been in development since 2016. Its ambitious aim is to transform the Internet into a giant, global computer that will take on the $370 billion cloud computing market by enabling secure, decentralized versions of popular applications such as Linkedin, TikTok, and WhatsApp.Key to this goal is smart contracts and interoperability with the wider web, as well different blockchain networks, which will enable different pieces of software to talk to each other seamlessly.To achieve this, “the Internet Computer is powered by novel ‘chain key cryptography’ that allows it to sign transactions for other blockchains such as Bitcoin,” said Williams. Since its launch, just four months ago, Dfinity claims that the Internet Computer has processed more than 200,000,000 blocks—far more than any other blockchain.Bridging with BitcoinBut Dfinity is not the only project working to integrate Bitcoin. Bridging technologies are the most popular method of doing so up to now.DeFi project Portal, is also looking to build out a DeFi ecosystem for Bitcoin. On Tuesday it announced an $8.5 million raise, with Coinbase Ventures and ArringtonXRP Capital participating in the funding round.“We're excited to see Portal's Bitcoin-native approach to multichain transfers go live and provide an alternative bridging mechanism to the growing number of active on-chain users,” Michael Arrington, founder of ArringtonXRP and TechCrunch, stated. In November, Bitcoin is due for its first big upgrade in several years. Dubbed, Taproot, the changes will make it easier for smart contracts to be created on the protocol. Bitcoin fan Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter and payments company Square, is keen to take advantage. In July, he announced that Square is working on a DeFi platform to integrate Bitcoin, and dubbed TBD.But all the activity has also captured the attention of regulators. They have raised concerns about the security and accountability of projects, and look to be doubling down on their vigilance of the sizzling hot DeFi space."

Like NBA Top Shot, the marketplace will live on Dapper’s own bespoke Flow blockchain, with plans to launch the project in summer 2022.Additionally, Dapper Labs has announced a new $250 million funding round led by investment firm Coatue, with participation from existing investors Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), GV (formerly Google Ventures), and Version One Ventures, as well as new investors BOND and GIC.The latest funding round values Dapper Labs at $7.6 billion, a source close to the company told Decrypt. Dapper previously raised $305 million in March at a reported valuation of $2.6 billion, with investors such as retired NBA star Michael Jordan and current pro Kevin Durant participating in that round.The new LaLiga project will be functionally similar to NBA Top Shot at its core, focusing on NFT “moments,” or licensed video highlights of top plays. An NFT acts like a deed of ownership for a digital item, and in the case of Top Shot, you’re buying what’s effectively a video-infused digital trading card. The LaLiga marketplace will follow a similar format.However, soccer doesn’t provide quite the same steady flow of showy, in-your-face plays as basketball does. Caty Tedman, Dapper’s Head of Partnerships, told Decrypt that creating LaLiga NFT moments will require more “finesse,” and require Dapper to be “really conscientious about how we treat content.” On the other hand, there’s a lot more shared history amongst teams in the league, and rivalries can make for compelling content.“A lot of the things that make sports special are the things that we want to lean into,” she said. “If you look at some of the rivalries in La Liga, you're talking about literally 100-year rivalries, and we don't really have that in North American sports. We think that it'll be really fun to lean into the derbies and El Clásico.”Dapper Labs and LaLiga began talking back in early 2019, Tedman said, well before NBA Top Shot launched the following year. It took a while to pin down the details and help the league become comfortable with NFT collectibles, but Tedman suggested that the global reach of soccer could help the marketplace tap into an even broader audience than Top Shot.Dapper’s announcement comes on the back of LaLiga joining Sorare, an Ethereum-based fantasy soccer game built around collectible NFT player cards. Sorare—which announced a $680 million funding round at a $4.3 billion valuation this week—doesn’t use video footage for its NFTs, plus the fantasy sports angle is a differentiator from what Dapper has planned.“I hope that there's room for different approaches and takes,” Tedman replied, when asked whether multiple LaLiga NFT projects could dilute the market. “I think we're very focused on distilling the best moments of sport, and making those something that you keep forever.”“I would hope that there's a world in which we all work together, and that this ecosystem is truly playing into the metaverse we all keep talking about,” she added. “I think if we each do what we're good at, there's a ton of room to play.”LaLiga will mark Dapper’s second sports-centric marketplace when it opens next year, following NBA Top Shot, which recently added the WNBA to its platform. The firm also announced plans with Ultimate Fighting Championship in February 2020, but has yet to reveal the fruits of that collaboration. Still, you can bet on additional sports NFT projects from Dapper Labs ahead.“Oh, for sure,” Tedman told Decrypt. “In the near future, we'll have more to say on that topic.”"

In July, the company led another $125 million funding round to support the mining firm’s “aggressive expansion plans.”“Bitcoin is going to be the most important technology for financial inclusion of the global poor and unbanked and mining provides security to make this possible. The [Genesis] team has been building highly profitable large-scale bitcoin mining farms for nearly eight years and the industry has only been around for twelve,” Kingsway Capital CEO Manuel Stotz noted at the time.US and Nordic expansionThe latest funding round is part of Genesis’ aforementioned “aggressive expansion plans.”In late August, just a month after raising $125 million, the firm announced that it signed an agreement with hardware giant Canaan to purchase 20,000 new Bitcoin mining machines.“The Bitcoin mining machines from this latest purchase order are part of our on-going (sic) efforts to rapidly scale our Bitcoin mining operations in North America and the Nordics where we are focused on energy that comes from renewable sources,” explained Abdumalik Mirakhmedov, Genesis’ co-founder and executive chair, at the time.Ultimately, the company plans to “dramatically” increase its mining capacity and reach 1.4 gigawatts by the end of 2023."

At press time, the sector boasts more than $160 billion in total value locked, according to analytics platform Defi Llama.Hsu had a front-row seat during the 2008 crisis, working as an economist for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission at the time. During his speech on Tuesday, Hsu compared the optimistic, and often deeply academic, climate around “innovative” credit derivatives back then with the overall intellectual climate and promises of crypto today. “[Credit derivatives] relied heavily on math and financial engineering. The intellectual challenges and the money attracted the brightest minds from finance to physics. They believed that they were leading a financial revolution, creating an entirely new asset class, using an entirely different set of models,” he said.Hsu also took aim at the DeFi sector for promising returns without outlining clear answers about how those returns are generated. “A wide range of DeFi platforms offer staking, yield farming, or liquidity mining. All of these are marketed as passive investing plays,” he said. “No active buying and selling is necessary. How are the returns generated? It is hard to get straight answers that don’t quickly devolve into crypto speak.”Crypto comes under scrutinyYesterday’s speech is the second time this month that Hsu has publicly compared the blockchain industry with the pre-crisis world of finance. At the beginning of the month, Hsu appeared on a Banking With Interest podcast and spoke about how the 2008 crisis is informing his current policy approach. Crypto has also been facing similar scrutiny from the SEC recently. Last month, SEC chief Gary Gensler told the Wall Street Journal that he is in favor of regulating DeFi. A couple of weeks later, he delivered a speech to the European Parliament calling crypto “highly speculative.” "

And these digital currencies, along with a lot of, if you look how the way the world is going, with all these different digital mediums and how they’re impacting currencies,” Brady added. This is not the first time Brady has forayed into the cryptocurrency industry. In June, he and his wife Gisele Bündchen took an equity stake in FTX, a crypto exchange led by Sam Bankman-Fried. “It’s an incredibly exciting time in the crypto world and Sam and the revolutionary FTX team continue to open my eyes to the endless possibilities,” Brady said at the time. The relationship between the exchange operator and Solana is also well-known in the crypto industry.In January of this year, Bankman-Fried offered a trader—who was bearish on Solana—to buy out all of his Solana tokens at a price of $3 per token. The trader did not take Bankman-Fried up on his offer, but the FTX CEO remains bullish on the Solana project.“Think of me basically as a fanboy. I think it’s a really cool product,” Bankman-Fried said in August, adding that “of the currently existing blockchains, it is maybe the only one, or at least one of the very few, which is being built in a way that it has a really plausible chance of eventually being able to host gigantic applications.”  The NFL world’s crypto embraceBrady isn’t the only NFL player to get on board with crypto in recent months.

As well as digital content, the company's h-NFTs contain sales and purchase agreements, evidence of ownership of IP, transfer deeds, and ownership title information.Lockdown isn't the first example of a film being released as an NFT; earlier this year, the documentary short Claude Lanzmann: Spectres of the Shoah became the first Academy Award nominee to be released as an NFT.And in July 2021, it was announced that Anthony Hopkins' next film, Zero Contact, a sci-fi thriller shot during lockdown, would be released as an NFT through blockchain-powered film distribution platform Vuele. Different tiers of Zero Contact NFTs would be packaged with a variety of digital extras depending on the price point, producer Rick Dugdale announced, telling film industry publication Deadline that,“It creates scarcity in copies of the film, and protects against piracy.”"

Big altcoins also took a beating. , the sixth biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, was trading at $122.20, down 13% on the day and 35% from its all-time high of $189 it hit just two weeks ago.  was worth $1.96 at the time of writing—a 6.6% 24 hour dip. Virtually every other altcoin was in the red too. In fact, the entire crypto market is wobbling: over $1.2 billion-worth of crypto futures got liquidated in one day. “Futures” refers to a massive market where investors place bets on the future price of crypto. Positions are often automatically liquidated—especially when they are overleveraged—when the market takes a nosedive. This is because traders won’t be able to pay back what they have borrowed to take a position.   The crypto crash is partly related to concerns over a global financial fallout because of a huge Chinese company called Evergrande. The Shenzhen-based real estate giant has a lot of debt—$305 billion-worth. Some are worried that China’s second biggest property developer won’t be able to pay back what it owes and this could lead to its collapse. Regulators have warned the country's financial system may be in trouble if Evergrande doesn’t find a solution. And the U.S. market could feel a potential Chinese economic mess because there are plenty of international asset managers and banks holding Evergrande’s dollar-denominated bonds. The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and global equity markets yesterday appeared to take a hit because of the uncertainty. Investors tend to flog riskier assets—this includes equities—when there is global economic uncertainty. Bitcoin seems to be no exception. But the biggest crypto by market cap had been struggling before yesterday: last week, the asset was struggling to make gains—despite El Salvador making it legal tender. The currency has not touched above the $50k mark since September 7. "

Cozomo has been tweeting steadily through his NFT journey in recent weeks, discussing the large sums of money spent on popular NFT collections while displaying an in-depth understanding of the culture.Snoop isn’t alone as a celebrity NFT collector: NBA athlete Stephen Curry, social media star Jake Paul, and comedian and TV host Steve Harvey are among the notable owners. And he isn’t even the first celebrity to create a separate crypto-centric “burner” account on Twitter: fellow rapper and YouTube personality KSI has one, for example, to keep his crypto musings off of main.But Snoop didn’t create his NFT-centric Twitter personality in public, linked to his existing social media channels. Before he chose to reveal it to the world yesterday, it was a pseudonym first with no apparent ties to Snoop.Also notable: Snoop appears to have a seriously valuable NFT collection. Cozomo de’ Medici’s has more than $17 million worth of collectibles within, according to DappRadar’s portfolio estimate tool.The collection is headlined by nine CryptoPunks, with the most valuable of the profile picture NFTs estimated at $4.6 million based on current market prices. The wallet also has 10 Meebits NFTs—the 3D avatars created by CryptoPunks makers Larva Labs—as well as a bunch of different NFTs from the generative artwork series, Art Blocks.An NFT acts like a receipt or a deed of ownership to a provably scarce digital item, and it can represent a still image, video file, video game item, and plenty more. Other valuable holdings in Cozomo’s wallet include an NFT from photographer Justin Aversano’s Twin Flames collection, as well as a couple of Moonshot Bots, which benefit the development of Ethereum tools. Earlier this month, Cozomo even tweeted about the value of supporting Ethereum developers.Snoop also appears to own several of Tom Sachs’ Rocket Factory NFTs—the same collection that Budweiser bought from. And like Budweiser, which found its wallet flooded with all sorts of random NFTs once the address was exposed to the public, Cozomo's wallet has been sent a steady stream of oddball collectibles since yesterday.In addition to tweeting out his pseudonymous identity yesterday, Snoop Dogg also retweeted noted NFT investor and project advisor DCinvestor. Additionally, Cozomo’s wallet owns the Snoop x Nyancat NFT that Snoop Dogg is currently using as his main profile picture.If it’s all a ruse, somehow, then it’s one that hasn’t yet been spoiled: Snoop has gone on to tweet non-NFT things, like a collaboration with Beyond Meats. Meanwhile, Cozomo’s account tweeted yesterday that it would no longer discuss the real person behind the pseudonym.“As my fame is considerable, the tweet will no doubt be discovered. Those who are curious to [know] my identity will soon know it,” Cozomo tweeted. “Those who do not care, or simply prefer to not know the source of my vast fame and fortune, may simply not research. I will keep this account focused on NFTs, and not mention this again here.”"
2021-09-21T20:19:41,"Ethereum Startup OpenLaw Rebrands, Aims to Be a DAO Incubator",https://wp.decrypt.co/81469/ethereum-startup-openlaw-rebrands-tribute-labs-dao-incubator/,"Digital contract platform OpenLaw is rebranding as a  incubator. OpenLaw, which aims to “automate the connection between the digital world and the real world using legal agreements,” will soon be Tribute Labs, according to co-founder Aaron Wright. It will work to support DAOs, shorthand for ""decentralized autonomous organizations,"" in the U.S. set up shop properly and legally. A DAO is an organization that spreads out control rather than having a hierarchy like a typical company. These kinds of organizations typically use  —bits of code that perform instructions—to run their operations. “We found a spot, just really supporting and helping to build DAOs,” Wright today said at the Mainnet 2021 conference in New York. “So OpenLaw is rebranding [as] Tribute Labs—we have eight [DAOs] that we launched and are forming kind of in the background, and the goal is to just keep on building more and more DAOs.”OpenLaw automatically creates and executes legal contracts. It does this by using , the network responsible for the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. But now it will help new DAOs navigate the complex legal world in the U.S. Like Decrypt, OpenLaw is funded by New York-based  software company ConsenSys.“DAOs are complex,” added Wright. “People are pulling together capital, they're trying to either make some sort of profit together, trying to build a company or project together. So our approach is a lot like , you know, we think that should be done the right way in the U.S., above board.” So far, Tribute Labs is working with eight DAOs, Wright said. He didn’t expand on what the DAOs did during the conference. Examples of successful DAOs right now include crypto projects, such as UniSwap, a decentralized exchange, or MakerDAO, which develops technology for borrowing and saving. Decrypt is now in the process of building its very own media DAO. The state of Wyoming in July introduced a law granting legal status to DAOs. It gave approval to the American CryptoFed DAO on July 5."

However, legions of  fans took to Twitter to protest the omission of the popular meme cryptocurrency, and it appears that their message was heard.Today, AMC CEO Adam Aron posted a poll on Twitter, asking users to vote on whether or not they would use Dogecoin to purchase online movie tickets and theater concessions.“I sincerely want to hear your opinion, via this Twitter Poll,” Aron wrote. “By year-end 2021, AMC will take , ,  and  for online payments. I hear from many on my Twitter feed we should accept Dogecoin too. Do you think AMC should explore accepting Dogecoin?”Aron listed four options split between Yes and No responses, ranging from “Yes, for sure do it” to “No, a waste of effort.” As of this writing, about two hours after the tweet was posted, more than 82% of the responses are positive with over 28,000 votes.Dogecoin’s fan base is often vocal on social media, but there’s an extra wrinkle here: just as DOGE is known as a popular meme coin, AMC is known as a leading “meme stock.”The meme stock movement began back in January, when users from Reddit community r/WallStreetBets began buying up stocks that were seen as low-value or past their prime by traditional metrics—such as AMC, video game retailer GameStop, and phone manufacturer Nokia.The prices for each stock rapidly climbed and fell, thanks in part to easy access to buying and selling via mobile trading app Robinhood. That led to regulatory scrutiny over Robinhood and stock trading behaviors, but AMC has retained a lot of this year’s value bump. At a current price of $39, the stock is up more than 1,800% since the start of the year.Dogecoin has experienced a similar upward trajectory, catapulted by rising social media sentiment and tweets from high-profile admirers like Elon Musk and Mark Cuban.The meme-inspired cryptocurrency was worth about half a penny at the start of the year, but has seen a more than 3,600% rise to a current price above $0.20, per data from CoinGecko. And that’s even with DOGE’s price now down a whopping 72% from the all-time high above $0.73 set in May.A pairing between a leading meme stock and the top meme coin seems like a natural match, and now it appears that AMC is leaning into the social media buzz and considering the move.AMC did not respond to Decrypt’s request for comment last week regarding the potential for adding Dogecoin to its crypto payment plans."
2021-09-21T18:25:04,QAnon 'Mastermind' Is Selling Ethereum NFTs to Fund 'Secret Project',https://wp.decrypt.co/81454/qanon-mastermind-selling-ethereum-nfts-fund-secret-project/,"Ron Watkins, who is believed to be a central force behind the QAnon right-wing conspiracy theory, has announced a series of -based  that he will auction off to fund a “secret project” that he believes will “save America.”The CodeMonkeyZ Freedom Series is a collection of five screenshots of tweets from his now-banned Twitter account. Watkins announced the project to his Telegram group, which counts more than 425,000 subscribers, describing the NFTs as a way to raise money for “Project Freedom,” an as yet unspecified initiative.The first Freedom Series NFT, which depicts a tweet sent on January 3 about the impending January 6 attack on the United States Capital, is now up for auction on NFT marketplace OpenSea. As of this writing, the current high bid is 0.21 ETH, or about $640. The auction will run until October 7.An NFT acts like a deed of ownership to a verifiably scarce digital item. In this case, Watkins is selling ownership rights to an image file: a screenshot of a tweet that is no longer available on Twitter, due to his account ban. Other public figures have sold notable tweets as NFTs in the past, such as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey selling his first tweet for $2.9 million in March.QAnon is a widely disproven conspiracy theory that began in 2017, focusing on supposed “Satan-worshipping pedophiles” that are secretly in positions of power, as researcher Travis View told Slate. Believers saw it as a campaign against former president Donald Trump, who is viewed as a messiah-like figure in the movement, and spoke of a coming “Storm” event that would see the purported offenders arrested en masse.Watkins is a former administrator of the 8kun (previously 8chan) message board, where conspiracy theories like QAnon have thrived. He resigned the position on November 3, 2020, the day of the U.S. presidential election, and has made right-wing media appearances in the months since. Watkins was banned from Twitter following the January 6 riots this year, via Twitter’s policy on “coordinated harmful activity.”Although he has denied being Q, the pseudonymous leader of the QAnon movement, Watkins alluded to performing the role during a filmed conversation with documentarian Cullen Hoback for HBO’s Q: Into the Storm series. He corrected himself, once more affirming that he is not Q, but Watkins is still believed by many to be a central figure in the movement and widely cited as its ""founder"" and "".""Watkins’ fans aren’t all thrilled about the NFT move, however. Some of his Telegram followers didn’t understand what NFTs are or why he’s selling screenshots of tweets, while others decried the move as a cynical cash grab. “Q told us if true Patriots had info they would NEVRR [sic] CHARGE for that information,” wrote follower Barb Watson.“For anybody who misunderstood my original post, I wanted to make it clear that I am trying to raise funds for what I believe is a critical project to help America,” Watson added in a follow-up post."
2021-09-21T17:07:10,OpenSea CEO: Exec's NFT Trades Were 'Misframed' as Insider Trading,https://wp.decrypt.co/81447/opensea-ceo-execs-nft-trades-were-misframed-as-insider-trading/,"Last week,  marketplace OpenSea parted ways with a top executive who was discovered using inside information to personally profit from trading non-fungible token collections on the site.But the platform's CEO tells Decrypt that the debate that erupted around alleged ""insider trading"" at OpenSea was ""misframing.""Speaking to  editor-in-chief Daniel Roberts and executive editor Jeff John Roberts at the  conference, OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer argued, ""I do think there was a misframing of it as insider trading. We don't view NFTs as financial assets, so that does not apply. That's a very specific term for a very specific thing.""Last week, OpenSea found itself in hot water after users pointed out that Nate Chastain, the firm’s now-former head of product, bought several NFTs immediately before they were featured on the platform’s main page.Following the community’s allegations, OpenSea later confirmed that one of its executives had indeed been profiting off insider information. The person in question ultimately left the company.What is insider trading?According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s definition, insider trading “refers generally to buying or selling a security, in breach of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence, on the basis of material, nonpublic information about the security.”In other words, insider trading occurs when a person—who is privy to some non-public information—uses their knowledge to make a quick buck via trading a firm’s stock.For example, if someone knows that a company is about to make a big announcement that will likely affect the price of its shares (for better or worse), they can buy or sell shares beforehand to make a profit after that announcement goes public.In this light, while buying and reselling NFTs ahead of them being featured on the site is not exactly “insider trading” on paper, the act itself bears many similarities. Finzer acknowledged this, arguing that while Chastain’s actions didn't qualify as insider trading under the strictest legal definition of the term, they were still wrong and could undermine OpenSea customers’ trust in the platform.“This was a relatively small thing that was done by an employee, we took action, that employee then resigned due to this,"" Finzer said. ""But we are putting in place more rigorous policies around the people who work at OpenSea and want to be able to participate in the NFT market.” He added, “We need to do it in a way that we build really strong trust with our community—and that's really the first priority for OpenSea.”To that end, the platform is crafting stricter policies “around what employees can do with the information and privileges that they have by working at OpenSea,” Finzer concluded."

Regarding the question of securities, Gensler said the SEC has a “great deal of authority” when it comes to crypto tokens that “have the attributes of an investment contract.”  “It’s highly likely that [lending platforms] have thousands of tokens, and it’s highly likely that they have on these platforms, securities investment contracts or notes or others that fit the definition of a security,” he continued, adding that “there’s going to be a problem on lending platforms or trading platforms.” "

Today's move makes Suex the first crypto exchange to be designated as such by the government agency.The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) alleges that the exchange aided in transacting funds obtained through illicit means, including transactions linked to at least eight ransomware variants. The agency’s analysis suggests that more than 40% of known transactions were associated in some way with such activities.Suex has been added to OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list, which means that U.S. residents and businesses are barred from doing business with the firm.The move comes amidst a push by the Biden administration to combat ransomware, following a string of high-profile attacks earlier this year. Ransomware is a type of software-based attack that locks access to computers and networks until a ransom is paid. Attackers often request cryptocurrency, which can be more difficult to trace than traditional payment methods.The White House stepped up enforcement following May’s ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, which caused fuel shortages on the United States’ East Coast. The firm paid nearly $5 million worth of  to the attackers, but unexpectedly, the U.S. Justice Department announced in June that it had recovered the majority of the extorted funds. analytics firm Chainalysis aided in the U.S. Treasury’s investigation into Suex, the company revealed this morning. According to the firm, Suex has transacted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crypto assets—particularly Bitcoin, , and Tether—”much of which is from illicit and high-risk sources.” Chainalysis pegs that number above $160 million worth of Bitcoin.Chainalysis writes that while Suex is legally registered in the Czech Republic, it appears to operate entirely within Russia. Its investigation suggests that Suex is allegedly converting cryptocurrency into cash at its physical locations in Russia, to aid in the movement of illicit funds. Suex also apparently received more than $50 million worth of Bitcoin from addresses hosted by former crypto exchange BTC-e, which U.S. officials shuttered due to alleged money laundering activities.“Today’s designation is important because it represents significant action taken by the U.S. government to combat the money launderers who make all other forms of cryptocurrency-based crime profitable,” Chainalysis writes."

According to the Financial Times, a letter sent by the trade groups said proposals to regulate the crypto space were “so overly conservative and simplistic that they, in effect, would preclude bank involvement in crypto asset markets.” The letter was signed by a multitude of groups, including the Global Financial Markets Association, the Institute of International Finance, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the Financial Services Forum, and the Chamber of Digital Commerce. The Basel Committee is responsible for setting the standard for the world’s approach to banking regulation. Earlier this year, Basel said that banks will have to cover their  holdings with their own capital—in other words, setting aside enough capital to cover any losses incurred. According to the Financial Times, the group said that such regulation did not recognize the diversity between various crypto assets. Instead, the group reportedly argued, the amount of capital reserve in place should be tied to the risk presented by each cryptocurrency. “We think everyone will be better off if regulated banks can meaningfully participate in these markets and provide access for their customers,” Allison Parent, executive director of the Global Financial Markets Association said. The group added that there was a “certain measure of urgency in ensuring that supervised banks can participate” in the crypto market. Crypto and regulationRecent months have shown that the crypto industry may well be on a collision course with regulators around the world. Gary Gensler, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States, has frequently cited the need for better consumer protection laws in the crypto industry—a view seconded by prominent senators like Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Gensler has also said multiple crypto assets may represent unregistered securities, and that cryptocurrencies have often been used to “skirt our laws.” Elsewhere, prominent exchanges in the industry have raised the ire of financial services regulators around the world. Binance, led by CEO Changpeng Zhao, has experienced a summer full of adverse regulatory updates from regulators in the UK, Italy, the Cayman Islands, Holland, Malaysia, Japan, Thailand, and elsewhere.

Coinbase Ventures participated in the round.DeFi, or decentralized finance, is the collective name of a system of interconnected smart contracts that allows users to act as financial institutions, rather than relying on banks or brokers. DeFi comprises a wide array of financial platforms focused on lending, , crypto derivatives, liquidity pools, and more.Based on a technology called Fabric, Portal aims to “deploy censorship-resistant layers on top of the Bitcoin base layer.”“By bringing a fast, peer-to-peer, Layer 2 exchange—with the speed of centralized exchanges but with privacy—Portal is delivering on the promise of self-sovereignty for everyone,” noted Portal CEO Eric Martindale. “Fabric technology enables Layer 3 privacy on cross-chain transactions and eliminates the need for centralized custodians.”As their name suggests, second (or third) layer solutions allow developers to deploy various protocols on top of blockchains to take some of the computations off the main network. This could be beneficial in several ways, including lesser load and higher customizability of a network.In other words, Portal’s developers are working to create a full-fledged DeFi ecosystem based on the Bitcoin blockchain—as opposed to Ethereum, where most DeFi protocols currently reside.Apart from Coinbase Ventures, the list of Portal’s funding participants also included ArringtonXRP Capital, OKEx, Republic.co, Shima Ventures, LD Capital, Monday Capital, GenBlock, Taureon, Autonomy Capital, Krypital, and B21 Capital.“Decentralized cross-chain bridging is one of the hardest problems in crypto right now, especially as multiple blockchains gain real traction,” said Michael Arrington, founder of ArringtonXRP and TechCrunch. “We're excited to see Portal's Bitcoin-native approach to multichain transfers go live and provide an alternative bridging mechanism to the growing number of active on-chain users.”Republic Capital’s Brain Johnson also argued that “interoperability is a necessity for blockchain to bridge into the mainstream finance world.” As such, his company’s investment in Portal was “with this future in mind.”Members of various well-known crypto projects have also invested in Portal, including Hedera cofounder Kyle Armour, Tether co-founder, Craic Sellars, CEO of Bitcoin.com Danish Chaudhry, and others."

This is because when markets are experiencing dips or surges, overleveraged positions are liquidated automatically by exchanges as traders can no longer meet their margin requirements.Naturally, long trading positions—where traders were betting on prices to go up—accounted for the lion’s share of today’s liquidations. According to Bybt, 83.53% of liquidated positions were long in the past 24 hours, making up nearly half a billion dollars.On the other hand, only $96.88 million worth of shorts has been liquidated over the same time period. In total, just over 205,000 traders lost their positions over the past day while the largest single liquidation, valued at $10 million, occurred on crypto exchange BitMEX.The Evergrande effectIt's not just the crypto market that's tumbled in recent days; other markets, including the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and global equity markets, remain in a downturn as well.Many analysts are attributing the global market slump to recent concerns around Evergrande, China’s heavily indebted property giant. According to CNBC, a potential collapse of the troubled company could even affect the global economy as a whole.“Evergrande is a systemically important company,” Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer at Rockefeller Global Family Office, told the outlet. “If China were to have a serious economic issue because of China Evergrande, the rest of the global economy would have contagion from it.”"

The poll, which was conducted by Redfield and Wilton Strategies, found that between 28% and 37% of voters—from Arizona and both Texas and Wisconsin respectively—would vote “yes” to a ballot that would make cryptocurrency legal. The poll surveyed over 9,700 eligible voters between August 20 to August 22 in California, and 20 to 24 in nine other states. Those include Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. “If a party wants to catch these receptive voters, it should act swiftly—not only to beat the other party to the punch, but also to preempt legislation that would prove difficult to reverse if enacted,” said Louisa Idel, head of insights at Redfield and Wilton. Unpacking the poll’s resultsGeorgia appeared to be the most divided state, with 27% of respondents saying they would oppose a national cryptocurrency, while 27% also stated that they would oppose such a policy. Arizona reported the most opposition to the policy, with 40% of voters against. According to the survey’s results, one of the biggest obstacles to using cryptocurrency as payment is a lack of information about cryptocurrencies in general. Approximately six in 10 voters said they opposed the policy because they did not know enough about cryptocurrencies. “Most voters also seem to have only heard or read about Bitcoin,” Newsweek added. National cryptocurrenciesSo far, only one country in the world has accepted any cryptocurrency as legal tender. That is El Salvador, which officially recognized Bitcoin as legal tender earlier this month. While El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, has been praised by Bitcoin advocates, the policy has generated significant controversy. Since President Bukele first announced the decision to embrace  as legal tender, El Salvador has seen protest, after protest, after protest. Major international organizations like the IMF and the World Bank have voiced concern over the policy, and even citizens of El Salvador have accused the government of silencing, harassing, and intimidating critics.Crypto in the U.S.The United States hasn’t embraced crypto to the same extent as El Salvador’s government, but some key political figures have taken a pro-crypto stance. One example is Francis Suarez, Mayor of Miami, who oversaw this year’s Bitcoin Conference in his own city. Throughout this year, Mayor Suarez has pushed a cryptocurrency ticket—creating a cryptocurrency team of his own, claiming that Bitcoin is “too big to regulate,” and even putting his money where his mouth is by purchasing some Bitcoin (and Ethereum) in a personal capacity. Mayor Suarez might want to make Miami the United State’s crypto capital, but he has some competition in New York. “As New York City Mayor, I will make NYC the most cryptocurrency-friendly city in the nation. Property taxes, fines, and fees will be payable in crypto,” said Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Silwa earlier this month. Democratic candidate Eric Adams—who won the New York Democratic primary earlier this year—also pledged to turn New York City into a “center of Bitcoins.”Yet another New York Mayor hopeful, Andrew Yang, also pledged to make the city “a hub for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies” earlier this year.
