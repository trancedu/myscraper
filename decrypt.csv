The Bitcoin mining facility belonging to Red Dog Technologies is allegedly breaching a zoning code. This means that the BrightRidge property is exceeding its permissions—in this instance, noise permissions— for the location it is in. Kent Harris, commissioner for Washington County, reportedly said the letter demands that BrightRidge complies with the warning within 30 days. If not, he’s made clear that further legal action would be necessary. “I think that it should be shut down. Litigation is something nobody likes, but if it comes to that, that’s what it’s going to come to,” Harris reportedly said. According to ABC Tri-Cities, the Bitcoin mining facility has been generating complaints since earlier this year, after residents issued complaints about a “loud hum” coming from the facility itself. Bitcoin mining has become a controversial practice in recent months as its damage to the environment has become better understood. Bitcoin and the environmentNoise pollution is not the only problem facing residents living near a Bitcoin mining facility. Bitcoin mining has also been linked to negative environmental damage in nearby communities. In upstate New York, a Greenidge Generation Bitcoin mining facility has been accused of warming the Keuka Outlet—a stream of water that flows into Seneca Lake—a body of water that is vital for the livelihood of thousands of people. In an interview with Decrypt, Greenidge Generation’s then-CEO Dale Irwin defended the firm’s activity by appealing to the number of jobs created by the facility. Yet, Seneca Lake is a microcosm of a much larger issue. The Bitcoin network consumes an immense amount of electricity—oftentimes more than most of the world’s countries. Based on the best available data, the majority of the Bitcoin network is not powered by renewable energy, but by carbon-intensive fossil fuels. As a result, the Bitcoin network produces greenhouse gas emissions broadly equivalent to 60 billion pounds of burned coal, or 9 million homes’ average electricity consumption for a year. Due to the fact that Bitcoin mining machines are single-use machines with very short shelf lives, the industry also produces high levels of electrical waste or e-waste. According to a study by Alex de Vries, founder of the Digiconomist blog, Bitcoin mining currently produces the same amount of e-waste as the Netherlands. Per transaction, Bitcoin produces 272 grams of e-waste, which is equivalent to two iPhone 12 Mini cell phones or half an iPad. Given the mining industry’s track record, noise might be the least of Washington County’s concerns. "

Last week, the Chinese government reiterated its crypto ban from 2017, condemning digital assets yet again.Following the news, at least two major Ethereum mining pools announced that they are ceasing operations in the country. Earlier this year, Chinese crypto miners also left the country after the government cracked down on the sector in May.Musk on China's crackdownMusk pointed out that China’s actions in regard to cryptocurrencies could’ve been prompted by concerns about the growing shortage of electricity in the country.“Part of it may actually be due to electricity shortages in many parts of China. A lot of South China right now is having random power outages because the power demand is higher than expected,” Musk noted. “Crypto mining might be playing a role in that.”At the same time, he acknowledged that cryptocurrencies might have some other political and financial implications as well due to some of their inherent qualities.“I suppose cryptocurrency is fundamentally aimed at reducing the power of a centralized government. They don’t like that,” Musk concluded.Still, China hasn’t been alone in sending nervous ripples across the crypto industry lately. Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, similarly reiterated that it’s important for cryptocurrencies not to “undermine the stability of the system.”“I think it’s better to bring it inside the public policy framework and ensure that we address these important public policy goals,” he stated."

Elon Musk, the CEO of the world's largest electric car company as well as SpaceX, is well-known for pontificating on everything from the imagined predilections of Thai rescue divers to his beloved .This morning, he stepped onto the Twitter hamster wheel that secretly powers every Tesla and pounded out  on the matter: ""Hamster has mad skillz!!""Mr. Goxx, whose name nearly matches the Mt. Gox exchange that suffered massive losses after a hack and alleged malfeasance by its operator, ""chooses"" which cryptocurrency he will trade by running on a wheel that's been segmented into multiple assets. He then buys or sells that currency by running through one of two tunnels; everything is wired to a trade desk.This method has helped Mr. Goxx and his anonymous owners outperform the Dow Jones as well as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Depending on the exact trading time, Mr. Goxx appears to have just about matched Bitcoin, which has gained almost 20% since the rodent started.That's been enough to impress Musk. Game, after all, recognizes game. With over 60 million followers, a single tweet from the King of Crypto can move markets. The price of  slipped after Tesla stopped accepting the cryptocurrency for merchandise—only for Musk to repeatedly kick BTC while it lay on the ground.Not everyone has been praising Mr. Goxx, however. Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus, clearly jealous that he didn't foresee the growing importance of so-called ""meme rodents,"" tweeted, ""It's all just dart throwing.""Bullseye."

For his next game, Wright’s first in more than a decade, he’s embracing  with an experience centered on .“Proxi” is Wright’s first new video game project since 2008’s “Spore,” and it has the same kind of inventive streak as his past creations. It’s a simulation game driven by artificial intelligence, and it’s designed to take players on a journey of self-discovery aided and enhanced by true ownership of digital, in-game assets.Developed by Wright’s new team, Gallium Studios, “Proxi” starts with players creating a personal diorama of memories using thousands of in-game items. Eventually, it generates a user avatar and lets them interact with other players. Along the way, Gallium aims to help players “gain more insights about their subconscious,” according to today’s announcement.“Proxi” is focused in part on user-generated content—following a trend popularized by smash hit games like Roblox and Fortnite—but also NFT collectibles. An NFT acts like a receipt for a provably scarce digital item, and while it can represent things like images and video files, it can also be tied to individual video game items that can be resold to other users.In this case, “Proxi” will let users own their memory creations as NFTs, and even profit from the sale of user-created items within the game. According to Bloomberg, “virtually everything” in the game can take the form of an NFT that can be resold to other users.Gallium Studios has partnered with NFT gaming platform Forte to handle the blockchain integration and NFT functionality. Forte will let users purchase NFTs with U.S. dollars, and the service is platform-agnostic, which means it can work with various blockchains. Back in May, Forte raised $185 million in funding at a $1 billion valuation.“I've always considered the community and their efforts an integral part of my games’ experience,” said Wright, in a release. “With Forte’s blockchain platform, we now have a secure way to integrate and reward the community’s contributions.”“Proxi” is set to launch on mobile devices this fall. Decrypt has inquired about additional platforms for the game, but did not immediately hear back. Initial starter packs of NFT collectibles are available today at $10 or $50 apiece, based on the contents within.The NFT market exploded in early 2021 with $2.5 billion in total transaction volume in the first half of the year, although recent figures suggest a much larger tally for the third quarter alone. For example, leading marketplace OpenSea had more than $3.4 billion in trading volume in August alone, per Dune Analytics, with September’s volume currently at $2.75 billion.Gaming is poised to be a significant part of the expanding NFT industry. Ethereum-based monster-battling game Axie Infinity is the current market leader with more than $2.1 billion worth of NFT sales to date, plus there are many more crypto games on the horizon.The Sandbox, an online 3D metaverse game, is another upcoming Ethereum game with a lot of buzz, not to mention alliances with the likes of Snoop Dogg, The Walking Dead, Atari, and more."

2021-09-28T18:43:39,Another Major Ethereum Mining Pool Has Shut Down Due to China Crypto Ban,https://wp.decrypt.co/82123/another-major-ethereum-mining-pool-shut-down-due-china-crypto-ban/,"A day after SparkPool, the second-largest  mining pool in the world, announced it would cease operations, the fourth-largest mining group has joined it.BeePool, based in China, announced today it would shut down on October 15 just before midnight and says it has stopped registering new users. BeePool said the closure came ""in response to the latest regulatory policies."" SparkPool also cited ""regulatory requirements.""According to data from the Etherscan block explorer, the two mining pools are responsible for over one-quarter of all ETH mined. Mining is the process by which transactions are processed and confirmed on the Ethereum network. People contribute computing power that helps secure the network; the more they provide, the better chance they have of winning the ETH that's doled out with each new block created. Mining pools work by letting people—as the name suggests—pool their computing power and share the rewards.The shutdown of China's two largest mining pools come amidst a renewed crackdown on cryptocurrency by Chinese authorities. Last week, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) circulated a notice that any activity involving crypto assets, including mining and trading, are against the law.The country has been progressively clamping down on crypto since 2017 when the PBoC prohibited financial institutions from conducting crypto transactions, but its efforts have ramped up of late. This past winter saw a major drop in  hashrate—a measure of computing power on the  that correlates to network security—as mining operations in areas with cheap electricity were told to pack up shop. In May, three major Chinese payments associations, including the China Banking Association, publicly repeated the PBoC ban in a prelude of what was to come. Just in the last several days, Alibaba—the Amazon of China—has said it would stop selling customized crypto mining equipment, while CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap—both of which provide up-to-the-minute crypto price data—have apparently been blocked by Chinese government censors. Major exchanges Binance and Huobi Global have already stopped registering mainland Chinese residents; Huobi has given current users until the end of the year to get off.The price of ETH has fallen sharply in the last 24 hours, declining 6.5% per CoinGecko. It now sits below $2,900. Bitcoin, too, has fallen 4.3% in the last day."

(ETH) has shed more than 6% of its value over the last 24 hours, currently sitting at a price of $2,861. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has bounced back from recent lows around $2,750 twice over the last week, but is trending downward again this morning.Competing platforms like  (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) have seen even larger declines over the last day. Both are dubbed “ killers” and seen as chief rivals to Ethereum’s dominance in the worlds of , peer-to-peer lending and trading, and —those crypto collectible tokens that have moved billions in value since the start of year.Solana is currently down nearly 10% over the last 24 hours at a price of $131. SOL climbed dramatically over the course of August and early September, rising from a price of just $35 on August 1 to an all-time peak above $213 earlier this month, per CoinGecko.However, a network outage that began on September 14 and lasted for more than 17 hours appeared to slow Solana’s upward momentum, on top of wider bearish market sentiment of late.Avalanche, also a big gainer in recent weeks, is down nearly 8% over the past day at a current price of $64. Like Solana, Avalanche has popped since the start of last month, rising from about $13 on August 1 to an all-time high above $79 on September 23.Likewise, Algorand (ALGO)—another challenger to Ethereum’s  dominance—is down more than 8% over the last 24 hours at $1.62. Alrogand likewise saw a significant pop in value in recent weeks, even doubling in value over the course of two days earlier this month.Not every notable cryptocurrency is taking hits this hard today.  is down less than 4% over the last 24 hours at a current price of $41,634, for example, while  (DOGE) has shed just over 2% at a price slightly below $0.20.Today’s crypto market declines may be tied into rising bearish sentiment amongst investors. Today, the Conference Board announced that the Consumer Confidence Index has dropped further, suggesting increasing caution in spending amidst continued COVID-19 concerns.The stock market is also down this morning, with the NASDAQ dropping more than 2% and the S&P 500 and Dow seeing less severe declines.This morning’s accelerated crypto market declines have also come during testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Janet Yellen, the United States Secretary of Treasury. The pair are appearing before the U.S. Congress to discuss the economic response to the impact of the pandemic."

Shortly after, the mining pool has returned the erroneous fee back to Bitfinex’s wallet via three transactions of 1 ETH, 7,385 ETH, and 240 ETH, respectively.While the mining pool that received the enormous gas fee is anonymous, it is currently ranked 9th among the largest Ethereum miners and is responsible for roughly 3.1% of the network’s hash rate, according to Etherscan.“Thank you to the miner of block 13307440 who we can confirm is returning 7,626 ETH that were incorrectly paid today as a tx fee,” decentralized crypto exchange () DeversiFi tweeted.DeversiFi was previously known as Ethfinex, a sister exchange of crypto trading platform Bitfinex. In 2019, the two firms parted company via a “management buyout” and Ethfinex was rebranded into DeversiFi. Notably, the three co-founders of the DEX also worked at Bitfinex in the past, as per Bloomberg.The connection doesn’t stop there, however. Due to yesterday’s events, it has now become clear that the DEX also has access to at least one of Bitfinex’s crypto wallets to help subside transaction costs for users.Transaction error: Bitfinex or DeversiFi?“At 11:10 UTC on the 27th September a deposit transaction was made using a hardware wallet from the main DeversiFi user interface with an erroneously high gas fee,” the DEX later acknowledged on Twitter.A spokesperson for Bitfinex also confirmed to  that the transaction in question “belongs to DeversiFi.”“This transaction was a transaction to deposit funds on the DeversiFi L2 solution. These transactions are extremely rare and third-party companies cover the costs of such integrations. DeversiFi confirmed that they will take care of it,” a Bitfinex representative told ."

A newly launched professional network aims to help people reconnect and thrive in the industry. And it just so happens to be led by 25 women.Crypto Connect, a ""decentralized organization,"" is launching today in 12 U.S. cities, with plans to quickly expand. Its chapter leads include Future Perfect Ventures founder Jalak Jobanputra in Miami; Aubrey Strobel, head of communications for Bitcoin rewards company Lolli, in New York; and Association for Digital Asset Markets CEO Michelle Bond in Washington, D.C. Board members include journalists Leigh Cuen and Naomi Brockwell, as well as Penn State law professor Tonya Evans. Podcaster Layah Heilpern and Chamber of Digital Commerce Chief Policy Officer Teana Baker-Taylor will help build out the group's international presence.While the nonprofit is led by some of the most active women in the space, it's for everyone working within the crypto space. ""The point of Crypto Connect is really to be a resource to connect successful individuals in the industry regardless of background, gender or anything like that,"" Crypto Connect founder and president Hailey Lennon told Decrypt.Lennon, a partner at prominent crypto law firm Anderson Kill, said the organization was borne out of her own experience traveling during COVID—as government quarantines and corporate work-from-home policies combined to make hotel conferences and happy hours nearly obsolete. ""I felt like my ability to ping into different communities and different cities as I traveled started to deteriorate and it made it harder to travel and network and continue getting to know people,"" she said.Over the last several months, she's tapped her network to jumpstart the nonprofit, which promises both in-person meetups and online webinars and educational seminars. By joining the database, members will also have access to referrals and mentoring.The group's representation is balanced, meaning just about anyone in the larger crypto community should be able to find resources via someone in a similar sector. There are lawyers and marketers, investors and engineers, journalists and academics. ""Having the various backgrounds and expertise on the board allowed us to mobilize very quickly,"" said Lennon.Membership is free and open to all within the industry. And, if men see the project's leadership and think, somehow, that it's not for them, Lennon assures them that's not the case. ""I actually think that men and women benefit more from networking when gender isn't the issue or topic,"" she said, ""but I also think it's important for women to see female-led initiatives and know that that's more than possible and should be more common."""
